xxxiv INTRODUCTION.

To say that Cicero is sometimes colloquial is not to accuse
him of provincialism, of anything such as the ‘Patavinity’
must have been which the ancients found in Livy. Corni—

ficius1 defines ‘Latinitas' as that ‘quae sermonem purum .

conservat ab omni vitio remotum ⁷ : and such faults he classifies
as ‘solecism and barbarism.' The educated society of Rome
were doubtless incapable of either. Their speech, though
conversational, was good Latin still: it was not the ‘ sermo
plebeius' of the Subura. We may judge this from the pure
and correct Latinity of Cicero's correspondents 3 it may be
much inferior to his in brilliancy and delicacy, but in other
respects the inferiority is slight. Doubtless the orator him-
self fixed a high standard of pure Latin for the society in
which he moved, nevertheless we ought not absolutely to deny
that his contemporaries exerted any reflex action upon him.

Thus we are merely asserting that there are certain con-
versational words, phrases, constructions, which, while they are
perfectly good Latin, might by a purist be considered inappro·
priate in elevated and serious wrsting, and that Cicero does
not scruple sometimes to adopt these in his oratorical style.

Professor Tyrrell has pointed out2 that there are frequent
correspondences between the language of familiar letter-
writing and that of familiar dialogue. There are also occa-
sional correspondences between the languages of both and
the language of public speeches.

We may classify our examples under three heads ε (a) fresh ’

meanings of words ; (b) special forms and uses of words,
(c) constructions and turns of expression.

(a) FRESH MEANINGS—
(1) Postulo, ἀξιόω, ‘to expect': ἓ 66 of this speech,

cupidiore quam fides iudicis postulabat. Cp. Plane. s ⁴

§57. Common in Comic poets: Pl. Tr. 237, nunquam
amor quemquam nisi cupidum hominem Ι postulat
se in plagas conicere.

(2) Indignum esse facinus, ξ 145 note, ‘a monstrous
thing' : Plautus only: Cic. has it also, ad Att. ii. 13.

(3) exclusus, ‘ shunned,' ἓ 175 note. Also in Hor.
Serm. ii. 3. 260, amator Ι exclusus qui distat.

(4) Possibly the ironical crede, so common in Cic. Cp.
Pl. Capt. 960.
