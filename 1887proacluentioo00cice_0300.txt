236 CRITICAL NOTES. [XXI. 59

That reading, however, can be accounted for: some copyist, unfamiliar
with the absolute use of sedulo facere, introduced hoc as object. Class.
illustrates the usage by quotation: Ter. Eun. ii. 3. 71, faciam sedulo,
dabo operam, adiutabo. A sentence in Rosc. Am. ἓ 59 (in context which
has other points of contact with the present passage) is very similarly
constructed, and supports the reading in the text: postea quam invenit
neminem eorum . . . ita neglegens esse coepit, ut . . . resideret, deinde
spatiaretur, nonnunquam etiam puerum vocaret . . ., prorsus ut vestro
consessu . . . pro summa solitudine abuteretur. 13. accusationi,
ST, all the Oxford codd.‚ according to Class., and all the Palatine codd.
accusatori, cod. F ranc., followed by Lamb., who explains ‘ praevaricando
accusatori inservire ’ 3 defensioni, some of Lambinus' codd.‚ who explains
‘ praevaricando, zle. mala defendendo, defensionem prodere.’ He adds :
omnino haec varietas suspicionem mihi commovet, has voces esse
adventicias. praevaricari is not construed elsewhere in Cic. with the
dat. On these grounds, Bait., Kays., Mun„ adopting accusationi,
bracket it. itaque cum . . . discesserat, Quint. vi. 3. 40. 15. re-
spicite iudices . . . discesserat, Rufinianus, de Fzgr. Sent. §4 respicite

is longe vividius. But iam tum would mean ‘thereupon’ or ‘next,'
whereas his verdict upon himself did not tlzen follow, but was already
recorded : only the legal verdict followed. ’

A meaning might be extracted from it by comparing ἓ 56, quem con-
scium fuisse arbitrabatur: the subj. might mean ‘because he was
supposed to be implicated'—a merely suspected connection with the
crime was enough to condemn. But this does not square with the facts.
