LXIV. 179.—33. Q. inserted rightly by Or. T hat it is necessary before
Metello, to distinguish him from L. Metellus (consul in the following year)
s no reason for its omission before Hortensio ; symmetry requires it in both
cases, clearness in the latter alone. It easily fell out before the familiar
name Hortensio. Pago 69, 1. 1. ahquid, STF, and rest, except one
MS. Wesenb. (ad Sest. p. 57) rightly denies that aliquis can in itself= alius
quis. The idea of alius is sometimes present (Verg. A. ii. 45, aut aliquis
latet error; Sest. ἓ 140, ex nostro aut aliquorum praeterea), but it has to
be derived from the context; cp. ἓ 171, ad fin. (with crit. n.), where quid
eripuit=quid (aliud) eripuit. If it cannot thus be derived (as in the case
before us), the reading must be at fault ; cp. Sest. §63, alia quapiam,
where one MS. gives alz‘quapiam. 5. possit, all MSS„ and most older
edd. ; posset, Lamb. in his earlier ed., Or„ and all modern edd. On the
principle stated in crit. nn. ἓξ 69, 134, I retain the MS. reading.

18o.—16. ex omni . . . serrulam, Priscian, iii. 7. 42, who preserves
dentatam (dentum, SF, etc. ; dentium, T). Plin. H. N. xxxvi. 22, in
Liguria . . . albus lapis dentata serra secatur. Mr. Davies (Hermath.,
l. c.) would omit ‘dentatam et tortuosam’ as an interpolation by some
one who wanted to supply the defect (which he supposes) in the descrip-
tion. V. explan. n.

Edd. generally prefer recup. 28. possitis is an emendation of the MS.
reading potuistis by Madv. Adv. ii. p. 200, who says of the latter ‘nec
tempus nec modus rectus esse videtur.' The MS. reading should mean
‘ what is this less probable view which you have been able to bring forward?'
which is very poor. The confusion of indic. and subj. is not uncommon
in MSS. 3 v. n. on noluit, ἓ 149. 29. After quaerebatur Kays. supposes
a lacuna 3 he thinks that words are needed for the transition to the narra-
tive. But he places a full stop at quaerebatur. A reference to explan. n.
will show that there is a complete sequence of thought in the section as it
stands, if we punctuate quaerebatur? 31. in, om. all MSS. except ST.

speech, ἐξ 68, 72; postea quam and postea cum, ἓ 192, pro leg. Manil.
ἓ 9, Verr. ii. 3. ἓ 57. Syntactic considerations make for Lambinus' cor—
rection. The MSS. exhibit postquam (postea quam) with the subj. only
12 times in all; a simple correction (cum for quam or indic. for subj.) is
always available. In Dez‘ot. ξ 36, Kays. reads, cum postea quam . . .
devictus est, Tauro tenus regnare iussus esset, omnemque hanc Asiam . . .
amisisset cet. (on the omission of est after -us in MSS„ v, Madv. Opusc.
Acad. i. p. 448). However, Hoffmann defends the construction. Dr'ag.
