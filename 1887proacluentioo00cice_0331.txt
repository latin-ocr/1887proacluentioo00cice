³- an. 174] CRITICAL NOTES. 267

ini-micum, om. all but ST ; found in Lamb. This illustrateS, as Class
says, his trustworthiness in following his codd„ even where they give what
seems superfluous. Pago 66, l. 2. audire, all MSS. First corrected to
adire in the Cratandrine ed. of 1528 : aspicere, ST, Lamb. ; respicere,
R. As Class. says, for the climax the reading of the text is necessary:
‘ domi suae aliquem non recipere, non adire domum eius, eum non adloqui,
denique ne aspicere quidem.’ Cp. also ἓ 41, a similar climart, aditu . . .
congressione . . . sermone . . . convivio. Ry. rightly distinguishes respi-
cere and aspicere, the latterly frequently denoting ‘ to see, without imply-
ing any exercise of the will‚' the former ‘ necessarily implying a deliberate
act ' ε and maintains that in the present passage we must prefer the former.
But upon reflection it will appear that aspicere (a mechanical rather than
conscious exercise of the will) gives exactly the sense here wanted—men
would not see Opp. when he stood before their eyes, they ‘ cut him dead ' ς
whereas respicere would not be nearly so forcible——men would not turn to
look after him. In truth there is rhetorical exaggeration in aspicere. Cp.
its use in a similar passage Catil. ii. ἓ 12, quis eum senator appellavit?
quis salutavit? quis denique aspexit?

rections by a second hand in the cod. S. Marci, n. 106, Lagom. 6 (as
Class. describes it)—as confirmatory of the evidence of ST as to a recen-
sion prior to that of the MSS. represented in the vulgate text. In the
present instance, the ‘second hand' has faithfully (though not intelligently)
altered mortem satis of R to casum minime of ST, and left the negative
non standing τ this might easily happen. There is thus no real hesitation
in the testimony of ST and b (corn). But the rest vacillate between the
reading with, and that without, non z naturally τ for casum minime being
