xvi INTRODUCTION.

acceptance of the orator’s statementS. We must remember
his own warning, twice given 3 once in the course of this very
speech (ἓ 139)—sed errat vehementer, si quis in orationibus
nostris, quas in iudiciis habuimus, auctoritates nostras con—
signatas se habere arbitratur: omnes enim illae causarum ac
temporum sunt, non hominum ipsorum ac patronorum 3 and
again by the boast which Quintilian tells us he made in regard
to this speech—se tenebras offudisse iudicibus in causa Cluenti,
‘that he had thrown dust into the eyes of the jurors on the
trial of Cluentius.’

ἓ 5. Now, it would be open to us at the outset to suppose
that Cicero has misstated the lex Cornelia 3 that in fact
Cluentius was liable under the Sixth Chapter, and was accused
under it, but that Cicero, while defending him on the question of
fact, has affirmed falsely that the provision in question related
only to senators, and taken credit to his client for not resting
his case on this technical basis. And indeed on another point
(v. note 5, p. xiv.) he has been taxed with misquotation. v

But enough has been said above to show that Cicero cannot
be convicted, on the ground of anything in the Digest‚ of having
misstated the lex Cornelia de sic. et ven. as it stood in his own
day.

§6 Two (if not more) recent students of this speech, Dr.
Carl Bardt and Mr. Davies, have taken up different positions.
T. Accius, they say, had only accused Cluentius under the
poisoning clauses of the lex Cornelia, although willing to take ’
advantage to the full of his moral (though not legal) violation
of the Sixth Chapter, on judicial murder: Cicero talks as if he
were being actually tried under that chapter. Bardt has
stated this position as forcibly as it can be stated, and a
review of his main arguments cannot here be neglected.

From what has been said, it will be apparent that the
orator is now accused of misrepresenting, by quotation, not the
terms of the law, but those of the indictment actually pre-
ferred against Cluentius. And Bardt tries to show that this
is done with a subtle ambiguity of expression, to which only
the greatest orators have attained.

(a) To begin with, there is the careful division of the case
against Cluentius into invidia and crimina: a distinction
drawn in the exordium of the speech, constituting its natural
line of cleavage, and reappearing in the antithesis offalsa
invidia and pericula at its close (ἓ 200).

(b) In the transition to the section relating to the charges of
