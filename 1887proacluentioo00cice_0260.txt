196 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [LIX. 163

choose between them as best he can by the help of the context. 14. de-
bere(se): v, crit. n. 15. Cei . . . repetitam ε the offence would be one
of ‘ plagium ' : cp. n. on ἓ 21. ⁴15. bellum : the Social War of B.c. 91-88,
called also the Italian or Marsian war: cadum Marsi memorem duelli,
Hor. C. iii. 14. 18. The Samnites in this war showed themselves the
irreconcilable enemies of Rome, and after it joined in the revolution of
Marius and Cinna; but were finally crushed by Sulla, B.C. 82, in the
battle of the Colline Gate and subsequent massaere. 16. sectoribus,
‘ wholesale purchasers ’ ε a word of disputed origin. The property of one
proscribed was sold by auction (sub hasta), as being that of a public enemy
(hostis), and in the lump. Such a sale was called sectio, and the purchaser
sector. Gaius sayS, ‘ sectores vocantur qui publica bona mercantur.’ Two
derivations are suggested :—(i.) The grammarians explain it ‘sectatores
bonorum‚' connecting it with sequi or secare=sequi. (Nonius, p. 404,
secare sequi, unde et sectatores bonorum sectores dicti sunt : quoting Verg.
A. x. 107, quam quisque secat spem.) The course of meaning would be
follow, petz‘tz'on, purchase. Expressions for buying and selling are vague
at first, then become definite : emo originally meant ‘to take’ (cp. adimo,
etc.) : to purchase meant ‘to acquire ' : πρίασθαι, ‘ to have a thing
brought across’ (sea for sale). (ii.) From seco, ‘to cut.' Explained in
two ways : (a) because the purchaser dz'vz‘ded up what he had bought, and
sold it in lots. But this is by no means of the essence of the word. R.
Am. ἓ 103, declares the sector to be ‘ bonorum emptor atque possessor)
[Mr. Roby however thinks that the word sector from secare may well have
denoted the position originally, although the purchaser did remain in
possession for a time.] (b) according to Mommsen, one who ‘cuts off ’ a
percentage from the gross value on account of the encumbrances on the
property, gives, eg. 80 per cent. instead of cent. per cent. This is far-
fetched. A full and satisfactory discussion of the words sector and secare
(=sequi) may be found in Prof. Nettleship‚ Essays, p. 369 sqq. We may
add that in Lucan, i. 178, sectorque favoris Ι ipse sui populus, the word.
means ‘sellem’ Terms of buying are sometimes confused with those
of selling: compare Cheapside‚ chaprnan, Lat. caupo (ξ 163), with
Germ. kauflm (buy). In the days of barter there was little or no difference
between buying and selling.

(c) CLUENTIUS HAS TAKEN THE PROPERTY OF ENNIUS.

163.—19. calumniator: v. Gloss. 21. cum servis furti egit:
‘ brought an action against the slaves for theft.' The expression, as equi-
valent to accuso, is used with the gen. of the thing charged: cp. Caec.
ἓ 35, an ages iniuriarum? Cp. n. on ἓ 97, maiestatis (condemnatus).
An accus. of the person is also found : Liv. xxiv. 2 5, tanquam reos ageret 3
cp. iv, 42, si reum perago. 22. fflo pr1vat0 iudicio, viz„ the trial for
theft, which, strangely enough, was a civil suit at Rome: v. Ry. R. Ant.
