xiv INTRODUCTION.

upon to heal the social as well as the political disorders of
the commonwealth, and he now stood before his countrymen
in a fresh character, as the founder of the criminal law and
criminal procedure of Rome. Foremost among the measures
by which he hoped to consolidate his new era, and by ‘human
statute purge the gentle weal,⁷ was the law of murder—the lex
Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis.

For its provisions this speech of Cicero's is our principa]
authority. There are notices also in the lawyers, but in these

it is not always easy to distinguish the original statute from its
subsequent modifications.

Sulla had also, as Cicero informs us, embodied in this law a
measure of C. Gracchus against judicial corruption on the

part of senatorsl Under this law C. Gracchus had consti-
tuted a new quaestio.

ἓ 3. It will be well to give a brief sketch of this law of Sulla,
as far as the materials for the purpose avail us.

The First Chapter 2 related (a) to murderers and assassins
under the general name sicarii 33 (b) to those who had gone
about armed with the intent to rob or murder3 (c) to the

instigator of a murder. In each case the presence of an
intent to take life is essential.

⁴¹ In this extreme case, the original punishment was drowning in a sack 3
apparently this punishment was nominally allowed but practically super-
seded by burning alive, by the lex Pompeia de parricidis. Cp. Ulp. Dtg.
xlviii. 9, 1. 1 ; l. 9 and 8, l. 3, §5 3 Paul. Sent. v. 24.

The lex Cornelia de iniuriis (Ulp. ngr. xlvii. 10, l. 5), which the
violence of the times had also necessitated‚ was probably a separate
statute, though Zumpt believes that it was a chapter of the lex de sicariis.
