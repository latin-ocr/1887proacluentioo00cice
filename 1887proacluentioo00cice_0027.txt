INTRODUCTION. xix

ferred however, not under Chap. vr. of the lex Cornelia, but
under the clause mentioned above (p. xv. n. 1), for which our
only authority is Paulus—mortisve causam praestiterit—though
Z. refers also to Cic. Phil. ix. 7, is . . . mortem attulit, qui

immediately followed the clause about ‘ judicial murder,' and
related to all persons without distinction. The question before
the court was the interpretation of this clause—‘ or has been
the cause of death.' The prosecutor explained it by the aid
of the preceding clause. But Cicero spoke as though Cluentius
had been accused under the preceding clause, and had not
much trouble in proving that under it he was not, as a knight,
liable. A similar view may be deduced from the statement
of Rein :1 except that for the clause quoted by Paulus (which
he assigns to imperial times)2 the clause ‘falsumve testimonium
dixerit' should be substituted. He seems to allow that the
application of the clause about ‘judicial murder' may have
been a matter of dispute among the lawyers of the time z the
clause about false witnesses, however, applied to all persons
without distinction. We should hence infer that Cicero was
‘misleading the jury when he referred the latter to senators
only.3 Thus in fact he is guilty of a twofold misstatement:
first as to the legal support of the indictment, and secondly as
to the terms of the law.

ἐς). We find ourselves then constrained to fall back on
what is substantially the old view. Cluentius was accused
under both clauses of the lex Cornelia, the fifth and the sixth.
Accius knew that in regard to the former his case was
strong in law and weak in facts, but vice versa in regard to
the latter. By combining the two counts in his indictment he
hoped to ensure a condemnation.

We might consider this proceeding more worthy of a
desultor riding in' the Circus Maximus than of an ‘ adulescens
bonus et disertus' addressing a court of law in the Forum.
It seems also singularly unfair that a knight should be charged
under a statute applicable to senatorial jurors for an offence
committed when jurors were still all senators, tle. before the

3 Itis not correct, as Bardt (p. 5) perhaps implies, to credit Rein him-
self with this deductiori. He simply says (p. 430) that Cluentius was

accused first of having bribed the Junian commission3 secondly, of having
poisoned Oppianicus.
