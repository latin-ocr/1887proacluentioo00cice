 

XXXIII. 90] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 145

relative clauses seems to be archaic, but is not very rare in Cic. Cp. ἓ 104,
qua lege . . . ea lege; in Catil. iii. ἓ 15, quae religio . . . ea religione.

. (Draeg. H. Synt. ii. §471, says that he has only found it twice in Cic.!

but several times in Cornifi) Cp. n. on ἓ 49. 33. ad quaes·
tionem : ut de ipso quaesitore quaereretur.——MAN. Pago 35, l. 1.
Voltus enim vestri . . . : enim gives the reason, not sor the question
itself, but for his putting the question. Cp. ἓ 70. The principle is the
same as that noted on ἓ 85, 1. 18, latter part of n.

9o.-3. illa tandem quaestio . . . fuit: attraction, v. n. on § 34.
5. cui tum populo: v. crit. n. 8. circumvenerit: cp. ἓ 30,
iudicio oppressum et circumventum innocentem; § 151, legem ne
quis iudicio circumveniretur C. Gracchus tulit. ‘ Compassed the ruin of
an innocent man.’ hac lege, the ‘ Lex Cornelia de sicariis et vene-
ficis‚’ which contained a clause referring to judicial murder, or the com-
passing by corrupt means of the conviction of an innocent man. Ry.
Rom. Ant. p. 305. The quaestio over which Junius presided administered
this law. V. n. on iudex quaestionis, p. 34, l. 30. 9. accusatum
oportuit ς the verbs volo, nolo, cupio, oportet occasionally take (especially
in the comic poets and Cic.) the perf. pass. part. instead of the pres. inf.
construction (the auxiliary esse being omitted). Cp. ἓ 129, sactum esse
oportuit, with note: also Pl. Cure. 304, te conventum cupit ; Ter. Andr.
239, nonne prius communicatum oportuit? At ipse ea. quaerebat:
the argument that Junius would have had to be summoned before his own
tribunal may seem inconsistent with the fact that there may have been as
many as three iudices quaestionis presiding over the quaestio inter sicarios
(as in this year Q. Voconius Naso, M. Plaetorius, C. Flaminius ; v. ἓ 147).
Mommsen’s hypothesis, that different iudices administered different sec-
tions of the lex Cornelia in this court may remove the difficulty.—Ro'm.

Staatsr. ii.2 574 a, 3. 10. exspectasset, not ‘ could have waited,' but --

‘ ought to have waited.' Quinctius ought to have waited a few days: “
then he might have prosecuted under the lex Cornelia. Cp. note on
rescinderent, ἓ 60. Exspectassetzexspectare debuit. There are two ex·
planations of this use of the imperf. and pluperf. subj. (not unsrequent
in Cic. and in the comic poets), which expresses ⁶ non id quod fieret fac-
tumve esset sed quod fieri debuerit.’ (a) It is the apodosis to a suppressed
protasis—‘si quod debuit fecisset! So Mr. Reid takes it, Sull. ἓ 25, si
ceteris patriciis me et vos peregrinos videri oporteret, a Torquato tamen
hoc vitium sileretur, supplying si caperet. (b) The force of obligation is
conveyed in the mood itself. It is indeed too express to be explained as a
nuance or variety of the potential subj. It stands in its own right, with
the jussz've subj. and the dubitative or deliberative subj. (subj. interroga-
tive of a command)-part of the original inheritance of Indo-European
syntaX‚ we may believe.l (Though the Lat. subj. is syncretistic, i.e.

subj. in Greek is almost lost. Yet v. Soph. Phil. 300.
