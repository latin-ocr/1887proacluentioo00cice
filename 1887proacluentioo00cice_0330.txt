n.‚ that a fair sense may be got out of these words as they stand. At the
same time it must be allowed that the similarity between the opening
words of ἓ 167 and 170 is singular and perhaps more than accidental. 1
would suggest that we have here two recensions (by Cicero's own hand)
of the argument as to Opp. tlte elder embodied m our text: quo tandem
zgz'tur. . .laederetur (ξ 170) is a more highly finished version of quid
umquam . .p0tuerit (ἓ 167); the words of ἓ 167 huic autem . . . ac-
cederet may have belonged to either place originally. And it would be
idle to attempt now to unravel what has been woven into a consistent
whole. 27. matre viva deesse non possent, all Mss. but ST, which

distinct force, especially when thus placed late in the sentence τ it marks
a new departure in the process of objecting t the new question being con-
trasted with those that precede. The speaker impatiently breaks off.
