que omnium datur cognitio sine consilio. Pago 13, l. 1. tum: sor by
the death of Num. Magius the tie of adfinitas waS, according to Roman law
and feeling, dissolved. So infr. p. 15, l. 21, Sest. §6‚ ademit Albino soceri
nomen mors filiae (ubi v, Holden). 2. iel quod conceperat. Cp. n.
on liberos, ἕ 31. The Indicative in indirect speech is not unfrequent
where the clause containing it is merely explanatory or contains a truth
for which the writer or speaker himself, and not the reported speaker, is
responsible: when in fact it is insulatea'. This is frequent in Livy: ag.
xxi. 27. 4 ; duces Galli edocent . . . insulae circumfusum amnem latiore,
ubi dividebatur, eoque minus alto alveo transitum ostendere. 4. Here
³1 qui natus erit (instead of the more regular esset) is an extract from the
will, lest out of construction with regard to the rest of the sentence. The
same diction appears in more than one place of the Digest: si quis mihi
ex eo nepos sive neptis natus nata erit. legat grandem pecuniam a
filio: fearing that the woman might procure abortion for herself. ‘No
legatum could be bequeathed except through a Heres, or as it was techni-
cally expressed ab herede, who was bound to pay it,’ Ramsay, R. Ant.

at the end of Plzz'l. ii.‚ si repraesentari morte mea libertas civitatis
potest, ‘ secured immediately.’ 12. si haec solutio . . . est, an
attraction for hoc .· ‘ a demonstrative or relative pmnoun, used substantively
, as the subjectos a definition, is usually attracted into the gender and number
of the defining substantive,’ R. 1068, r. 451. Cp. §96‚ vis illa fuit3
ἓ 171, mortem quod illi unum . . . erat perfugium calamitatis; Verg.
A. vi. 128, sed revocare gradum ‚. . . hoc opus laic labor est3 Soph. Tr. 483,

it denotes a cause lying outside the agent, except in certain formulas,
causa, gratia, macte virtute esto, substantives in u which have no other
case (iussu, rogatu, etc). Su‘ch a case we have in Phil. i. 30, se bene·'
ficio novo memoriam veteris doloris abiecisse, and in the present passage.
