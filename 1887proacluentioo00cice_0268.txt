204 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [LXII. 174

In the other case the poison might long remain ‘abditum aliqua in
parte panis ' before permeating the body of the victim. 31. sl esset
animadversum, sc. venenum, ‘ if attention were called to it.' Not
strictly logical: in that case the question would cease to be one of
degree 3 the answer is non falleret, not non tam facile falleret. Precision
is sacrificed to terseness: the attempt to poison is confused with the
poison< itself.

174—Pago 67, 1. 3. in eo ipso, repentina morte Oppianici.

175.—7. undique exclusus, ‘universally tabooed': no one would
open the door to him. Cp. Ov. A. Am. iii. 69, quae nunc excludis
amantem: frequent in the Com. poets. 8. 1.. Quinouus, in all pro-
bability the tribune, his late advocate: the only man likely to receive
him under the circumstances, and so Cic. does not qualify the simple
name by any addition. 111 Falernum, agrum, not praedium (as
L. and Sh.), though the latter is the common ellipse: the preposition
(in not ad) is in favour of the former. [Perhaps sub. fundum, cp. ἓ 141.-
H. J. R.] The ager Falernus, famous for its wine, lay in the north of
Campania, between the Massic Hills and the river Volturnus. 9. ae
satis vehementer diuque aegrotavit: not an example of the change of
connecting particle (ac . . . que): ac connects the verbs, and que the
adverbs‚ which taken together are qualified by satz's.1 11. colono,
homine valenti, ‘ a lusty yeoman ’ (P. ). His rude health is contrasted with
the illness of Opp. For the abl. in iv. crit. n. 12. v1r masclatis,
simus, ‘ Opp. in spite of his looseness ' : καιπέρ ὢν ἀσελγέστατος (dol-'eh-
in σαλεύωε a ‘shaky‚' loose character). le. firmjrzzfl, obs. 1. For
homine . . . v1r‚ ep. n. on ξ 77. incolumi fortuna pau posset,
‘could have tolerated had his fortunes been what they once were': not
as Ρ., ‘could have endured in the days of his prosperity' : posset is con-
temporaneous with uteretur, and the protasis is contained in the abl. abs.
For incolumis cp. ἓ 10 n. 15. servulus, ‘a favourite slave ’ς for the
force of the diminutive (here laudatory), cp. ἓ 37, n. on muliercula.
18. ad urbem, ‘to the neighbourhood of Rome': ‘aquae et ignis inter·
, dictio‚’ excluded him only from the city itself. 19. cecidisse de equo
dicitur: not a very confident assertion. Cp. Introd. p. xxxiii. 20.1atus
offendisse vehem„ ‘ sustained a severe contusion of the side’: v. Gloss.
22. Mortis ratio, ‘the circumstances of his death ’ z V. Gloss.

LXIII. 176.-28. quast ut Idem faceret, ‘ostensibly with the same
design as that of Habitus in the purchase of Diogenes’: quo facilius
comprehenderetur res eius indicio , ἓ 47. 30. quaessturam esse tunt:
for omission of pronominal subject to infin. cp. posse arbitrati sunt, ἓ 36.Ι
Here, in the case of a composite infin. form. the presence of esse is
exceptional: contrast de Fin. v. § 31, si quando eis minamur praeci-
pitaturos alicunde, for nos p. esse: and cp. Liv. xxviii. 23. 6, perfugae

pollicentes urbem prodituros esse. V. crit. n. here. 31. ‘Whom she .
