tial processi0n3 cubiculi, z'.e. of the thalamus nuptialis; cubile, the
lectus genialis. In limen there is no special reference: except in so sar
as a stumble on the tlcreslzold in going in or out of the house was always
unlucky (cp. the story of Tib. Gracchus stumbling as he left his house on
the day of his death, Plut. Tib. Gr. c. xvii.), and to guard against such
an accident the bride was lifted over the threshold as she entered the
house. V. Ramsay, Ant. p. 424. 16. parietes ipsos z for the idea of
‘ stones crying out‚’ cp. Aesch. Ag. 36,

οἶκος δἀὐτὸς εἰ φθογγὴν λάβοι

σαφέστατ’ ἂν λέξειεν,

and Eur. Hipp. 416,

οὐδὲ σκότον φρίσσουσι τὸν ξυνεργάτην

the latter of which may have been in Cicero⁷s mind. 17. vicit pudorem
libido, timorem audacia, rationem amentia : this arrangement of words,
the verb being placed first or last to hold the parts of a divided statement
together, is called adiunctio by the rhetoricians (Cornif. iv, ξ 38 ; Quint.
ix. 3. 62, who quotes this passage, with Catil. i. 22, where the same three
substantives appear—neque enim is es, Catilina, ut te aut pudor umquam
a turpitudine aut metus a periculo aut ratio a furore revocaverit). Cp. n. ’
on coniunctio, ἓ 1, l. 16. Cicero is partial to triplets in asyndeton: cp.
p. 5, 1. 3, virtute existimatione nobilitate: also ἓ 9 aa' fin. ; ἓ 14 adfin„

Comp„ p. 55. 21. nihil sibi . . . gravius . . . esse faciendum quam
ut . . . ne : cp. ἓ 6, Ιιοε postulo . . . ut ne, ἓ 168, quod ficit viri optimi
fecisti ut ne . . . The ordinary rule is that ut ne is used only in final
clauses ε ut non only in consecutive clauses. The former part of the rulc
will not hold: as appears from Fz'n. ii. ἓ 24, ex quo efficitur, non ut
voluptas ne sit voluptas, sed ut voluptas non sit summum bonum, com-
pared with ib. ἓ 15, e quo efficitur, non ut nos non intellegamus sed ut
