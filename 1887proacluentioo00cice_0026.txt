xviii INTRODUCTION.

consistently used the most invidious term he could« find to
characterise the charge which he felt to be the best authenti-
cated? And in §5 8, 125, the latter too appears as crimen,
Cluentianae pecuniae crimen.

As to (b), the jurors must have all belonged to the country
tribes, if Cicero could reckon upon their believing that such
questions (as that of judicial corruption) did not ‘fall under
the cognisance of their court.’ Whereas, upon the view which
I hope shortly to propound, a good sense is given : ‘the
charge of bribery against Cluentius, a Roman ang’lzt (be it
remembered), is one which does not concern your court,
which does not fall within the scope of the lex Cornelia which
that court administers, and which consequently you are not
by your oath bound to investigate) The orator in fact takes
his stand, despite his disclaimer‚ on the letter of Chap. vl. of
the lex Cornelia.

As to (c), the distinction of usage in the speech is not so
consistent that much importance can be attached to it. It is
neglected in ἓ 165, 1ηὲ 168, and in ἕξ 169, 183, where obiectum
est, dixz'stzk, dicitis severally appear in connection with the
charges of poisoning.

But it is when Cicero speaks of haec lex, ea lex, that the ad-
vocate of this theory is reduced to his worst shifts. In ἕ 116,
‘hac lege ipsa‚' upon any natural interpretation, refers to the
Sixth Chapter of the lex Cornelia, and in §g 154, 156 Cicero
says outright that Cluentius was accused, is pleading his case, ’
under the Sixth Chapter of the lex Cornelia Here then we
must suppose him to have passed from prevarication of a
somewhat clumsy sort to absolute untruth. For it is idle to
urge that the latter of the objectionable passages is preceded
and followed by perversioris of fact. The issue is simple:
‘ A. Cluentius causam dicit eques Romanus ea lege, qua lege
senatores et ei, qui magistratum habuerunt, soli tenentur! If
this is not true, it is what the orator himself would have styled
‘ magnum et impudens mendacium.'

ἓ 8. Two other views may be noticed, which in one respect
accord with that of Dr. Bardt: in so far as they too suppose
that Cicero wished to misrepresent the terms of the indict-
ment.

Zumpt1 supposes that the main charge against Cluentius
really was that of bribery in the trial of Oppianicus : it was pre-
