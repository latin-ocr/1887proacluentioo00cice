108 EXPLANATORY NOTEs. [xm. 37

6. longum est: we say ‘it would be tedious.’ In phrases such as longum
est, fuit satius, aequius erat, utilius fuerat, expressive of duty or power,
Latin prefers to state the absolute existence of the duty or power at a
certain time, irrespective of conditions which in fact limited its exercise,
using the indicative ε English, less logical, conditions it by such fact, and
uses the potential. Sest. ἓ 12, longum est ea dicere: sed hoc breve
dicam. R. 1535, r. 643.

37.—8. mulierculam, ‘mistress’z the Diminutive is contemptuous ;
cp. ’γύναιον (Plut. Themist. xxvi. ἓ 3); γυναικάρια σεσωρευμένα ἁμαρτίαις
(S. Paul’s Ep. ad T z'm. ii. 3. 6). Cp. Graeculus esuriens, plebecula,
rumusculi (ἓ 105); lacrimula (Plane. ἓ 76), ‘a crocodile-tear.' But some·
times the force of the Diminutive is good-humoured: ἓ 72, aliquid
speculae, ‘some glimmer of hope': gloriola nostra (Fam. v. 12. 9).
These divergent applications may be illustrated freely from Cicero's
letters: contrast Tulliola (Cicero’s daughter) with chlclzellzcs (Clodius).
In the famous lines of Hadrian to the soul, beginning ‘animula
vagula blandula,’ a pathetic force is given. In lzortulz' (infr. 1. 15),
‘pleasure-grounds' seems to render the effect best3 servulus (ξ 175),
‘a favourite slave': in many cases it is more easily felt than expressed.
τὸ ὑποκοριστικόν in Diminutives is as characteristic of Cicero as of
Catullus. V. Nagelsb. Stil. ἓ 46. 11. obsignatoreS, ‘qui esta-
mentum obsignant ’—-according to lnstz'tut. lustin„ seven Roman citi-
zens of full age. [Obszgmatz'o was not a mere sealing, as in modern
times in attestation of a deed, but was a sealz'ng up of the wax tablets‚
so as to prevent their being opened and altered improperly.—H. J. R.]
12. nossent, consecutive after qui (=tales qui). R. 1680, r. 704.
14. brev1 1110 tempore, v. n. on ἓ 22, l. 26. 15. hortulos,
cp. n. on 1. 14. It is plain from de Off iii. ἓ 58 that lzorti and hortuli
can be used indifferently of the same pleasure-grounds. The singular
and plural differ in meaning: the latter, ‘a pleasure-ground' (cp.
horti Sallustiani, h. Maecenatis, at Rome) ; the former, ‘a kitchen·
garden.’ 15. harenarias, ‘excavations made sor the purpose of obtaining
the volcanic sand now called “pozzuolana.'' This has been extensively
used sor building purposes from a very remote epoch‚ and thus the almost
endless maze of the famous Catacombs has been formed' (Ry.), the scene
of early Christian worship and burial ε cp. Prudentius, ‘n‘epl στεφάνων :

inlitas cruore sancto nunc harenas incolae
confrequentant obsecrantes voce votis munere.

38.—-16. ‘ Had been sought in vain ’ for one or two days : note on p. 3,
l. 5. R. 1460, r. 596. 23.tr1umv1r—one of the IIIviri capitales,

otherwise called popularly IIIviri nocturni, or even IIIviri alone: insti-‘

tuted first about 13.C. 289. They form one division of the vigintivirate‚
which body, together with the quaestors‚ made up the magistratus
minores at Rome. . These triumvirs acted as adjutants to one or other
