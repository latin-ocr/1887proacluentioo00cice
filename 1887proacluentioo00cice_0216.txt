152 EXPLANATORY NOTEs. [xxxvi 99

viction of Staienus?' Non dico . . .‚ a common form of occupatio—
τῖε. the implied assertion of a thing by the expression of an intention of
passing it over. Cormf. iv. ἕ 37 calls it occultatio: ‘quom dicimus nos
praeterire aut non scire aut nolle dicere id, quod nunc maxime dicimus.'
(Mark Antony's funeral-speech in Shakesp. Jul. Caesar affords repeated
instances of this device, employed to rouse the dormant passions of

the citizens z

‘ O masters, if Ι were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong . . .
I will not do them wrong. . . .
But here 's a parchment with the seal of Caesar . . .
Which, pardon me, Ι (10 not mean to read.'

8. nescio an, ‘ I almost think,’ in Cic. a modest affirmation. An in-
troduces the second member of a disjunctive interrogation. Pl. Rud.
i. 2. 16 gives the original form of such questions: utrum tu masne
an femina es? ‘ Which of the two [is true]? are you male or female?'
Then sor the first member utrum alone became the interrogative particle,
answering to an, or -ne alone was used, or no particle at all : or tlte first
member is wanting altogether. In this last case the expressed member
(with an) has a tone of irony or wonder which a simple question with -ne
would lack. Here (a) cp. ἓ 136, an potuit rem delatam eiusmodi
repudiare? (with n.) ‘ Do you mean to say that it could have refused ?’
As a general rule, a negative answer to the question (as asked) is expected z
an=num. (b) But sometimes not : v. ἕ 65, quid tacetis? an negare non

potestis quod repetistis? de Off. i. §48‚ quidnam officio provocati facere ‚
debemus? an imitari agros fertiles, qui multo plus efferunt quam accepe-
runt? This--num quid aliud f. debemus an imitari . . .? Thus an
almost-:nonna The single an—clause, dependent, answers in character
to (b). When governed by nescio, dubito, and the like, the expressed
alternative with an is that to which the speaker inclines : ad Att. ii. 6. 1,
qui etiam dubitem an hic Antii considam, ‘why‚ I actually consider
whether it would not‘ be well to settle down here at A.’ Cp. R. 2254-

2256, r. 887, 888; notes on ἕ 65, § 136. 11. Mam. Aemilio:
v. crit. n. praefecti (socium): these were Roman officers nominated

by the consuls to command the contingent of allies 111 the combined army
of Romans and allies In a corps d‘armde of two legions, the allies (falling
into two divisions, the ala dextra and ala sznz‘stra) would be commanded
by six praefecta (The allies had their own officers besides.) [Marquardt‚

Ram. Staatsverw. ii. p. 396.] They answer to the tribum militares of
the Roman contingent, who in the case supposed would be twelve in
number. 15. nomine iud. Saum: cp. ἓ 68 supr. for the circumstances
nangae, ‘ on account for,' ‘ under the head of ⁷ z nomen, properly the
debtor's name entered in a ledger 3 so ‘ an entry‚’ ‘ a debt‚' in such phrases
