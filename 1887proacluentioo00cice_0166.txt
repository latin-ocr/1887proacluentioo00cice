102 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [X. 29

and her money: nothing has been said of any hopes entertained by Sassia.'
But the next sentence evidently contrasts the spirit in which Sassia now
closed with the offer of Oppianicus with the spirit in which (according to
327, l. 7-10) she had previously spurned it. ‚‘N ow in high spirits and
strongly re-assured by her prospects.' 30. quod, ‘ whereas,’ serves to
contrast opposites, especially, according to Classen, where of a certain
number the remaz'nderl are opposed to one or a few who are excepted.
So ἓ 190, ita quod apud ceteros . . . haec mulier . . . putavit. V. crit. Vn.
‘ So far from coveting money for the sake of his children, as most men do,
he found a pleasure in sacrificing his children for the sake of money.’
The antithesis is more verbal than real.

‘the debt of nature ⁷: Plzz'l. xiv. 31, o fortunata mors, quae naturae debita
pro patria est potissimum reddita. Cp. also, sor the personification
of Nature as a party to this transaction, Sall. lug. 14, pater, uti
necesse erat, naturae concessit. 9. ‘You hear facts which might be
treated at the greatest length, treated by me briefly and superficially.’
Strictim is connected with stringo (akin to στραγγεύω, ‘strangle'):
which has two main senses, ‘to draw tight or fast,’ ‘to graze the sur-
sace.' (For the connection of the ideas, cp. in English ‘sast,' ‘fast
by ²). Strictim accordingly denotes (a) ‘compactly,' (b) ‘passing over
the surface,’ ‘cursorily.' Cicero uses many such adverbs in ·im,
expressing the mode qf action, e. g. pedetemptim (ξ 118), summatim (ἕ 19,
:per summas loquendo, ‘taking the prominent points ⁹), separatim
(ξ 64), nominatim (ἓ 185), acervatim (ἓ 30,=per acervas tractando,

‘taking the facts in the gross'). R. 533, 534, r. 227. The sym· ·
metrica] arrangement of the members of the contrasted wholes, vos . . . ”
dicuntur, illi . . . diceretur, must be noticed. As vos auditis is 'taken ⁴

up by auditis, so is illi audiebant by audiebant: and the articulation
of the main sentences on either side corresponds. But each of the
former clauses has a magnified reflection in each of the latter clauses:
thus to ‘de eo in quem iudices non estis' answers ‘de eo de quo iurati
sententias ferre debebant.' And thus with ‘et (εἶτα, ‘after that’) est
quisquam . . .' we can fancy the orator's clenched hand sall on the table
before him, as he indignantly demands, ‘Will any one now declare that
the jury which condemned Oppianicus condemned an innocent man?’
ending with scornful emphasis upon the word innocentem. 11. con-
sceleratum, strengthened form of sceleratum .· cp. decet and condecet,

press any supposed imperfect sense os oderant in order to save the creditos
Cicero’s advocacy, which may to us seem injudicious in this naive admis-
sion that the jury hated the man on whose guilt or innocence they had to
pronounce. Ramsay would do so, explaining, ‘they were gradually
becomz'ng filled with detestation of his reckless villany, and were arriving
