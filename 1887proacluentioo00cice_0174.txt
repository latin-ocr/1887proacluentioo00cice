to be pressed. The account in ἓξ 21, 22 must be compared: we learn
that Dinaea survived her children, M. Aurius, Cn. Magius, and Oppiani-
cus’ wife Magia. M. Aurius and a kinsman, A. Aurius, were made away
with after her death (§§ 23-25): nor is it hinted above that any of the
three former perished by foul play. 15. ‘An itinerant Qack': pro-

bably he was a libertus. 15. admeditur, ‘makes zadvances to’: a -

me'taphor ‘from war: cp. Sall.hlzcg..xvi.‚ reliquos legatos eadem via
aggressus plerosque capit‚—oi‘bribery. 16. transigit ‘ bargains.’ It
is a technical word >for a settlement, often a compromise [H. J. R.].
17. fora multa restarent, ‘ who had many market-towns to finish'z the
ordinary meaning of resto: Pers. iii. 97, iam pridem hunc sepeli: tu
restas, and other cxx, in Prof. Nettleship's note on Verg. A. X. 29. Fora.
is also used of the assize-towns which the praetor visits on circuit in
his province: Verr. ii. 2. 169, cum praetorem circum omnia fora
sectaretur.

41.—21. fuisset : Subj. giving the reason. For the tense, cp. n. on p. 13,
l. 1 : ‘had been ⁷ as long as Magia lived. 24. adulterinis, ‘forged ἐ
so Sall. lug. xii. clavis adulterinas, ‘ false keys ἐ and the words of the lex
Cornelia de falsis (under which this crime might have been punished), sig-
numve adulterinum sculpserit fecerit expresserit.-—Paul. Seni. v. 25. 1.
The word is elsewhere explained—adulterina signa dicuntur alienis anulis
facta . . . sculpere-facere exprimere (Paul. Diae. p. 28). Anulus is the
signet-ring, signum, its impression. 28. censoriae, of the censores
of Larinum. Originally the census of the whole burgess body of
the Roman State was conducted by a central authority, the Roman
Censors; before whom each citizen registered himself in person. When
this became impossible in practice, the censors employed delegates,
who collected the names of Roman citizens serving abroad. - Liv.
xxix. 37. 5: lustrum conditum serius, quia per provincias dimiserunt
censores, ut civium Romanorum in exercitibus quantus ubique esset
referretur numerus, But with the growth of the municipal system in
Italy, decentralisation went forward; and even before the enfranchise-
ment of Italy in 13.C. 90-89, which stereotyped it, each municipium had
its own censors. The Roman censors determined the time and procedure
of the census on each occasion: the municipal censors held it by their
mandate. This appears in the lex Iulia of B.C. 45, quae municipi'a . . .
c(ivz'um) R(0manorum) in ltalia sunt erunt, quei in eis . . . maximum
mamislratum) . . . habebit tum cum censor aliusve quis mag(z'stratus)

Quintil. ix. 3. 38, quotes this as an instance of what he calls πολύπτωτον
