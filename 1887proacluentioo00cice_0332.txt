268 CRI‘rtcAL NOTES. [an. 175 ’

glossed with mortem non satis, non was lost and mortem saus ousted ’-
casum minime (as in the four inferior MSS.): then non was inserted

before haberet to give the right sense. 2. quodsi, ST ; si, R.
175.—-8. 1.. Quinctium, ST, one MS. of Lamb.: C. Quintilium, R.
Had this person been L. Quinctius the tribune, probably Cic. would have ,
indicated this, nor would the name have been likely to be altered: so we>
might argue for the reading of Kayser, G. Quinctium. But the ‘argu-
ment from silence ' has to be employed with great caution. 10. eaque
Sex„ ST b (corr.); et Statio, R3 Abbio (or Antio, or Attio), STM b

(corr.) and others. Albio, R. 11. valenti, ST (just as sapiens! vecors -ζ

audax); valente, R.—In adjectives and participles of one termination,
where the word is adjectivally used, the abl. may end in -i or in -e, but the
former is commonet : where the word is substantival, οι· participial (as in
the abl. absolute), -e is the abl. ending. Wesenberg (observ. in Sest. pp.
6, 7), goes too far in insisting that Cic. always wrote sapienti, etc., when
the word is adjectival. 19. de, ST ; ex, R.

LXIII. 176.—25. Sassia, bracketed (aster Beck), by Bait„ Kays. ’

27. Ruptum T 3 Rut1110, S. 28. From quendam tog 182, et ceterorum
honestissimorum, there is a lacuna in M. 30. Ascla, T and others3
Asela (with c superscribed) S; assecla, R (including F). A Neapolitan .,
inser. confirms Ascla. quaesituram se esse, Lamb. The text, as ³j
Bait. says, could be emended q. esse se or q. sese. In de Fin. v. ἓ 31, we '
have minamur praecipitaturos alicunde z Madv, refers to this passage and
Verr. ii. 1, ἓ 97, descensuros pollicebantur and ii. 2, 93, addit . . .
exacturum, as instances in which there is no trace whatever osa flaw in
the reading. Though he thinks the omission of the pronoun doubtful in
Cic.‚ he hesitates to deny it altogether, seeing that it is common in Caes.
and Ter. We have already noticed it as an instance of colloquial usage in
Cic„ which (if we are to accept the testimony of the MSS. as we receive it)
is by no means uncommon. V. explan. n. on ἓ 36, posse arbitrati sunt.

Pago 68, l. 6. vehementissime, ST; vehementissimis, R. 8. et vi 2

tormentorum, all Mss.; Halm thinks this interpolated 3 Kays., Miill.
bracket. But the words give a fair sense. V. explan. n. I have felt it
necessary to substitute atque sor et ; indeed ilisa can ill be dispensed with.
The sylleptic use of atque is somewhat similar to that of ἓ 20, ad Staienum
atque ad pecuniam confugisse. Klotz conj. and reads a. vi tormentorum
. . . abduct1; quoting ad sam. v. 13. 4, se 'abducere ab omnibus modestiis
et angoribus, inadequate for his purpose.

177.-—11. post, Kays. brackets. 13. adversari, T, and two inferior
MSS., Bait„ Kays., Mull.; adversarii, SF, and rest; aversari, Man.
conj.‚ Lamb.‚ Or. Ry.‚ Kl., which would be stronger than iam vix ferre
posse, which follows. 24. homo et, om. T.

178.—25. aperte . . . occulte, F. 27. Stratonem (om. a), T; pet
stratonem, S b (corr. ), apparently retaining 1110. As to b (corr. ), cp.
ἓ 174, crit. n. on a similar transcription of ST.
