ΙΙΙ. 8] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 85

apertae’: infr. §63‚ tacita vestra exspectatio. Pago 3,1. 1. ad ex-
tremum: generally ‘at the end ' (so in ἓ 50): here ‘till the end.’ So
Caec. ξ 46, qui ad extremum usque contenderint. The other reading (v,
crit. n.) would make extremum a neut. subst., ‘the end,' sc. causae, which

- Ι could hardlybe omitted.

111. 7.-—5. ex contraria parte, an adverbial phrase, ‘on the other
side.' Cp. de Inv. i. ἓ 26, quod ab adversario potest ex contraria
parte dici. So Liv. xxii. 59. 15, si ex altera parte cernatis stratas
Cannensibus campis legiones vestras. ‘A case of which these eight
long years you have been hearing the other side.’ audiatur: Pres.

of an action which has continued from the past into the present. So ,

Pres. with iampridem, etc., and in Greek with πάλαι; R. 1460, r. 596.
6. tacita, n. on p. 2, 1. 33. 7. qui indefinite >is generally an adjective,
quis a substantive : but there is no rule absolute. Exceptions to the
former'usage are much rarer than exceptions to the latter : yet they occur
even in Cic.‚ unless we set aside the MSS. altogether. ἓ 61, si qui ab illis
quaereret : ἓ 103, l. 123 ξ 105, 1. 12. Sull. §43, ne qui posset . . . me-
minisse : de Or. i. ἓ 127, si qui forte sit tardior. Aliquis in the same
way is both substantival and adjectival: aliqui (l. 12) is adjectival, and
rare: ἓ 113, l. 10, it is substantival, ἓ 184 adjectival (v. note). In the
neuter the forms are strictly distinguished. R. 380. r. 208.1 13. ‘ I
am in great hopes that, if I can bring out in detail the points which are
latent in my case [explicare]‚ and can do them justice in their entirety by
my advocacy, this court in which you are met, so far from being, as his
enemies expected, a tribunal of impending doom to Cluentius, will prove
the final haven of refuge to the long and sorely tried bark of his fortunes.'
Tacite rogat ut causam patrono meliorem putent. ——MAN. 14. potuero ε for
the mood cp. n. on p. 2, 1. 32. 15. eum, taking up again the antecedent to
quem, points the antithesis. Cp. Sest. ξ 59, amicitiae nomen ac societatis,
quod armis violarat, id precibus est consecutus. Balb.§ 20, si ea lex, quam
nos haberemus, eadem . . . resedisset3 infra‚§ 115, 1. 3, ea . . . eadem.

8.-18. dieo : for the pres. indicative cp. §6‚ ante quam . . . incipio, and
v. R. 1462, r. 598. 19. communibus invidiae periculis, ξ 4, 1. 13.
20. ‘ Still, that Ι may not task your patience any further by my remarks, Ι
shall address myself to the actual charge—appealing to you at the same time,
gentlemen, as I feel I shall have to do more than once, to accord me the
hearing which Ι might expect if the case were now being argued sor the first
time, as in fact it is, and had not been often argued before and always un-
, satisfactorily.' Cp. ξ 88. 21. adgrediar ad. crimen: Sest.‚§ 3, a. ad dicen-
’ dum. probata, ‘ made goodj ‘made out to the satisfaction of the public.’
So ἕ 138, iudiciorum quae probata non essent, ‘ trials which had not given
satisfaction.' crimen, the charge of having bribed the jury (ἕ 9, 11.

· 30, 31) 3 to be distinguished from the veneficii crimina (ξ 1). This
