CRITICAL NOTES.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

IN the editions of Cicero's works issued between the years 1472 and
1826, the latter year being that of the first edition by Orelli, the text of
this speech, which we may call the Vulgate, was gradually constructed. It
is based on the testimony of the majority of extant MSS., supported largely
by that of the editions of Lambinus (the first in 1566, the second in 1584),
Gruter, and Graevius, editors who had among their authorities some MSS.
which have since disappeared.

The edition of Classen, published at Bonn in the year 1831, marks an
epoch in the history of the text of this speech. He was the first to
discover that the MSS. whose evidence is wholly or in part available to us
represent two recensions of the text, of which the inferior one had unfor-
tunately gained currency, and he was the first to vindicate the superior
authority of the other recension by a careful collation of its manuscript
sources, which, as far as it went, left little for later editors to do.

The verdict of Classen has been accepted in all essentials by later editors
of Cicero 3 that is by Baiter and Halm in their second edition of Orelli's
Cic. (Ziirich, 1854); by Mr. Long in his edition of the Speeches (1856) ;
by Klotz in his successive editions, that of the Speeches (1835), the first
Teubner edition of Cic. (1856), and the second (1882); by Baiter and
Kayser in their edition of Cic. (1860) ; lastly by C. F. W. Muller (Teub-
ner ed. 1885).

The only advocate of the Vulgate text (in its main features) has been
Prof. W. Ramsay of Glasgow, whose edition of the speech has been re-
vised with little or no alteration by Prof. G. G. Ramsay of Glasgow (third
edition, Clarendon Press, 1876). His introduction, especially§ 13, should
be consulted for an „able defence of the old text against the attacks of
modern editors.

The manuscripts upon which the labours of Classen are based are the
