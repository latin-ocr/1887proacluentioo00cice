vn. 20] CRITICAL NOTES. 225

called in for the defence of a friend (and therefore might be justified in
giving Sassia no quarter).’ There is force in the repetition of hominum ;
it gives the key-note of the argument. Cicero nowhere speaks of Cluen-

,tius as ‘ amicus.'

’ explaining thus—-‘ cmgflatum is the crude metal heated in the furnace

in order to be forged or smelted, perfidum the finished work produced
from it.' But here the point to be asserted is that Sassia orzgz'nated,
was at the bottom of, every one of her son's trials: sor this sense
of conflatum (with which profectum is synonymous), cp. explan. n.
on ἓ 9. The variant perfectum may be due to the slight harsh-
ness in the double use of a matre with the two participles, ‘by'
and ‘from.' 8. sed. vero (ST and inferior codd.) sic agitur (SF),
ut prorsus reticeri nullo modo possit (ST): so Class., Bait., Kays.,
Halm, Kl.‚ and Miill. (reading however reticere). Sed. ea vero (M) sie
agit (TM) ut prorsus reticere (R) non possit, which Ry. adopts, explain-
ing it to mean ‘ but Sassia is acting in such a manner that in no way is he
able altogether to refrain from publishing her guilt'—-—which is satisfactory
as *far as the sense goes; yet in smoothness and finish it seems unworthy
of the highly-wrought passage in which it is imbedded. Agit indeed has
good MS. support 3 but the change of agitur ut into agit ut is easily ac-
counted for 3 the gloss ea would then creep in (which reads like careless
writing after the ea in the preceding line, which is in a different case ε and
illa is wanted). The impersonal reticeri is supported by the similar words
in ἓ 17, de turpitudine matris dici vix oportere. 12. Madv. (Append.
disp. de Asconio, p. 49 sqq.) conjectures issa omnis testium copia. If any
change were needed, it would be better, with Kayser and Miiller, to bracket
accusatio. 13. huius opprimendi . . . Here the Turin palimpsest

be laid down for the choice between ac and et. There is a tendency to

conjunction of words (such as terra marique, sometimes terra ac mari).
