xxiv INTRODUCTION.

Sassia was gone, her daughters remained, and she was likely
to have provided for them in her will.

ἑὸ. The plot of Oppianicus to remove his stepson by
poison speedily ensues. It was to be carried out by the
instrumentality of a low knave named C. Fabricius, through
whom overtures were made to Diogenes, the slave of
Cleophantus, a physician who was then in constant attend-

ance on Cluentius. The slave prudently listened to him, and ,

then went straight to his master, who informed Cluentius.
By the advice of his friend M. Baebius, a senator, Cluentius
¹bought the slave from Cleophantus. <Another witness to
the truth of these facts was P. Quinctilius Varus, a man of
unimpeachable character, who had heard them at the time
from Cleophantus, ἓ 53.) Then a trap was laid, a secret
interview was arranged between Scamander, a freedman of
Fabricius, and Diogenes: eye-witnesses concealed themselves
to watch it, and surprised Scamander with the poison and
the price for it both in his hands.1

This story as told by Cicero can scarcely be said to go on
all-fours. Why was Diogenes selling the drug to Scamander,
instead of taking it to administer himself? This looks as if
the whole thing was got up by the friends of Cluentius to
ruin Oppianicus, whom he had every reason to hate. BesideS‚
the attempt to poison is discovered at a very early and imperfect
stage: it depends on the sole evidence of Diogenes, who was
at the time of the trial actually a slave of Cluentius: why*
bought by him it is not at first easy to say. Those who
disbelieve this whole narrative reply, Because a slave could
not give evidence against his own master. On the other
hand, we may find sufficient reason in the following con-
siderations: the enemies of Cluentius would gain courage,
seeing that now they had his ozon slave to deal with3 they
would be tempted on to their own ruin. Cluentius, too,
might without suspicion confer directly with his own slave.
And for the substantial truth of his story, Cicero can appeal
to the evidence of respectable men: would M. Baebius have
lent himself to a vile plot for the ruin of Oppianicus?
Lastly, there is the fact that the almost unanimous verdicts
of two Roman juries ratified this story.

ἓ 7. Cluentius proceeded, before attacking the prime mover
of this attempt on his life, to impeach two subordinates in
