INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

confer' (Pl. Poen. 1222) and ‘utin pauca conferam' (CaeC.
ἓ 17), we shall be inclined to account it a case of more or

³² · less conscious borrowing on the part of the later writer. But

in numerous instances this will not apply 3 and we shall pre-
fer to believe that Cicero, purist as he was, was far removed
from pedantry and conventionalism. The occasional col-
loquialism of his diction is due not to a careless habit of
composition, but to the sincerity and living energy of his
style. Unlike the rhetoricians of a later day, he was in touch
with the people: their speech at its best was his.

Notes on tlte persons.

(a) A distinguished citizen of Larinum ; died in consulship of Sulla and
Pompeius, B.C. 88, ἓ 11.

(b) V. ἓ 30 for an account of her death.

(c) She was grown up (grandis et nubilis) at the time of her father's
death, soon after which she married A. Aurius Melinus, her first cousin on
the mother's side ; two years aster was suddenly divorced by her husband,
who married Sassia. It is probable that L. Aurius was the issue of this
and not an earlier marriage of A. Aurius Melinus (v, ἓ 23 n.). In ξ 165
we find Num. Cluentius called the son of Cluentius' sister ; it may be con-
jectured that he was a son of this marriage, born after the divorce. After
the separation, Cluentia probably lived with her brother, ἓξ 11-14.

(d) The defendant: a Roman knight. F ifteen years of age in B.C. 88
(ἓ 11) ι therefore twenty-nine at the time of Oppianicus’ trial, and thirty-
seven at the time of the present trial.
