not for the fact stated (condemnarat) but for the fact of its statement as
something noteworthy (eum condemnavisse velim animadvertatis). It is
an instance of the principle of substitution noticed upon ἓ 85, 1. 17. For
this acquired meaning of praesertim cum or cum praesertim cp. Mayor's n.
on Phil. ii. ἓ 60, who quotes Madv, (de Fz‘n. ii. ἓ 25); saepissime cum
praesertim et pr. cum (nullo, quod animadverterim, discrimine) et qui
praesertim eandem vim habent ac si dicas ε idque cum tamen, quamvis, qui
tamen. 22. contionibus, ‘ public meetings,’ V. Gloss. An instrumenta]
abl. 24. non suae decuriae munere, ‘ usurping a duty which did not
belong to his decury.' The exact significance of this last expression dur-
ing the period here in question, B.C. 81 to B.C. 70 (from the lex Cornelia
iudiciaria to the lex Aurelia), is not very certain. The album iudicum or
list of jurymen to serve throughout the year in the different courts would
seem from Β. C. 70 onwards to have been made out by the praetor urbanus
from the three orders (senators, knights, tribuni aerarii), each of the three
forming a decuria. (Augustus added a fourth, the ducenarii 3 cp. n. on
ἓ 121, l. 12.) But during this preceding period, senators alone being com-
petent to serve, the roll of the senate was itself a list of jurymen, magis-
trates in office being excepted. Then comes the question, What were the
decuriae? (i.) Some explain them as subdivisions of the senate, con-
sulares, praetorii, and the other ex-magistrates (Zumpt, de leg. iudic. repet.
p. 37), referring to Verr. ii. 2. 79, hic alteram decuriam senatoriam iudex
obtinebit? But this is slender evidence. Madvig however accepts the
inference from the passage (Verfass. ii. p. 225). (ii.) It is more pro-
bable that each decury was at this time a division of jurors which
served in one particular court or quaestio: Verr. i. ξ 16, in sortitione
istius spem fortuna populi Romani et in reiciendis iudicibus mea dili-
gentia istorum impudentiam vicerat : ‘in the balloting for the decury
which was to try Verres’ case Rome’s fortune had triumphed over his
hopes‚' etc. The Schol. GronOV. explains this passage thus : per decurias
erat senatus divisus ; unam decuriam praetor dabat, ut ex hac iudices
reicerentur. Ergo fortuna populi Romani fecit, ut ea decuria daretur a
praetore, quae paucos habuit malos ; mea autem diligentia fecit ut meliores
eligerentur.—Fidiculanius Falcula had broken the law in two points t (a)
though not belonging to the decury which was to serve in the quaestio de
veneficis, he had allowed himself to be placed upon a jury in that court ;
(b) he had served, his name not being entered in the praetor's register. V.
