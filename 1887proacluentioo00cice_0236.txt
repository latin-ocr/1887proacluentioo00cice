172 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XLV. 126

the right of defence was reduced by the censors of Β. c. 70 to very small
limits, while he does not positively assert that the accused had no hearing,
which he probably would have mentioned had it been the case. V. Momms.

however is very considerable.' The relative has an antithetical force,
being equivalent to quae tamen ι cp. Sest. ξ 115, sit hoc sane leve, quod
non ita est. In such sentences we have sometimes the indic., sometimes
the subj. ι ἓ 178, quae a Stratone . . . venenum . . . viro suo datum

legatus . . . fuisset in invidiam adduxit. In the latter case it may be
more convenient to call the relative concessive (=quamvis ei). The
indic. simply asserts the fact as il is, the subj. expresses the connec-
tion of this fact with others. The former is more usual when the qui-
clause follows, the latter when it precedes, the principal verb: cp. two

appointment of lower state-officials such as this ‘ aediles’ clerk ' seems to
have rested with the board of magistrates (in this case the college os aediles)
whom they were more particularly bound to serve 3 but the higher magi-
strates (as here the praetors) exercised a certain control over the selection.

rium reliquisse subscripserunt: v. crit. 11. 011 the important variants
here. Momms. says that aerarium relinquere is simply a synonym for
aerarium facere (R. Staatsr. ii. 388 n.), quoting Liv. xxix. 37, which
runs thus: exitu censurae, cum in leges iurasset C. Claudius, inter nomina
eorum. quos aerarios relinquebat dedit collegae nomen. Deinde M. Livius

. xxxiv tribus aerarios reliquit . . . Inter xxxiv tribus et C. Claudium
aerarium fore. Earlier in the chapter we are told that either censor bade
the other equum vendere τ surely this was aerarium facere, and the action
aerarium relinquere, marking the close of the censor’s term of office (exitu
c.)‚ is a confirmation of this act, ‘ to leave a man among the aerarii, where
he was already.’ We should expect aer. facere to have been used of M.
Livius’ wholesale visitation : but as it was done in retaliation for the act
of C. Claudius, and done just before the censor gave up the registers, the
same phrase is used of it. In another passage, de Off i. 40, a similar
phrase (which Momms. says ‘is different '), in aerariis relinquere, occurs. It
is used of the punishment of ten Roman prisoners of Hannibal, who broke
their parole and stayed at Rome. As prisoners, they were already capite
deminuti, hence it can be said ‘ eos censores, quoad quisque eorum vixit
