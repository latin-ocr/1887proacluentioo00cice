INTRODUCTION. xvii

poisoning‚ Cicero twice uses ambiguous words : ξ 160, reliqua
(these charges as opposed to that of bribery) quia vestrae
quaestionis erant, profirenda 3 ἓ 164, cognoscite nunc id, quod
ad vestrum ius iurandum pertinet, quod vestri iudicii est . . .
de criminibus veneni. That is, the charge of bribery is ‘ non
vestrae quaestionis, non vestri iudicii ': ‘ you have not before
you the bribery charge.> And why not? The true answer is,
because it is not a count in the indictment 3 but this would be
inconsistent with the tenor of the speech, and the jurors are
meant to understand the words thus—‘ because such questions
do not fall under the cognisance of your court)

(c) But there are also many isolated expressions carefully
chosen so as to mislead. When speaking of the bribery
charge, Cicero prefers the vague phrase causam oblinere
(gg 145, 156) to the usual term, absolvi (contrast absolvatis
of a hypothetical parallel, ἕ 158), and prefers to introduce the
charge itself by dicitur, dicitis, and the like indefinite expres-
sions (§§ 9, 39, 88, 90, 138), whereas the charges of poisoning
are introduced by dicis or dixisti.

Again, the word lex is ambiguous, it may denote either
the whole law or the Sixth Chapter alone : ἓ 154, illi (equites)
non hoc recusabant, ne ea lege accusarentur, qua nunc Habi-
tus accusatur, quae tunc erat Sempronia, nunc est Cornelia:
intellegebant enim ea lege equestrem ordinem non teneri.
So ἓ 156: A. Cluentius causam dicit eques Romanus ea lege,
qua senatores, cet. ’

(d) Lastly, there is the difficulty of understanding how the
prosecution could have impeached Cluentius under a statute
under which they knew that he was not amenable.

§7 Cicero was doubtless fully capable of the chicanery
which is here attributed to him. Of that the Cluentiana will
afford ample evidence. But the indictment which Dr. Bardt
brings against him, while strong on the side which ancient
rhetoricians would have called the ‘probabile ex vita,' is not
so strong in the ‘probabile ex causa.’ If we take his last argu-
ment first, it is outweighed by a difficulty on the other side ε
could Cicero haxse deliberately imposed upon a Roman jury
as to the counts comprised in the indictment? One juror,
who had kept his eyes open, might have exposed the glaring
sophism, and the advocate's credit would have been ruined,

Next, if we take the other arguments seriatim, their cumu-
lative force is considerable, but they will not all bear an indi—
vidual scrutiny. As to (a), why should not the orator have
