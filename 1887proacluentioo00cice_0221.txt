On the primary object of the leges de repetundis (to deal with maladmini·
stration in the provinces), and the history of the quaestio de repetundis and
⁴ the successive laws which it administered, v, Ry. Rom. Ant. pp. 306, 307 z
and an excursus in Heitland and Cowie's Cic. div. z'n Caec. et Verr. a. pr.
pp. 53-55. Pago 40, l. 3. more maiorum (a phrase too common to

⁴ need illustration) is almost invariably a term of praise in the mouth of the

true Roman, who is a ‘fautor veterum.' 4. aliud. si . . . debuisse:
we may wonder that Cicero should seem to approve of such a perfunctory
discharge of duty by a juror: and may be tempted to turn the tables
on him, and ask how it would fare with Cluentius, if alleged praeiudicia
were to take the place of evidence and counsel’s pleading with the present
iudices. On the construction of adducti sunt v. crit. n. The reading
of Ernesti, addocti, which Madv. calls barbarum, might give a fair sense,
‘were brought to see‚' ad implying a graduated lesson. 7. On the
personal use of constarent v. crit. n.

XXXVIII. 105.——10. rumusculos aucupati, same expression in leg.
iii. ἓ 35, dissidente a bonis atque omnis rumusculos popularis aurae
aucupante: ‘idle plaudits.’ A contemptuous diminutive from rumor,
‘the common talk ’ : cp. the use of the simple noun in Ennius’ famous line
(of Q. Fabius Cunctator)—

noenum rumores ponebat ante salutem.

In Verg. A. viii. 90, iter inceptum celerant rumore secundo, the cheertng ’ἵ >

of the rowers is denoted ε cp. with this rumorem, ἓ 131. On the diminu-
tive cp. n. on ἓ 37. 11. qui, as in ἓ 103, 1. 12, ubi, v. crit. n.
si . . . quaereret: si interrogarentur: si essent rogati: quaesitum si
esset: the more vivid presentation of a supposed past action given
in the imperf. is abandoned for the alternative form of statement as an
assumption contrary to the fact. 16. ‘For no one voted for an
acquittal,’sc. of Fabricius. 18. una sententia: according to § 55,
that of Staienus. ’ 19. vellet, hypothetical subj., the tense denoting
continuous action in past time, tum (like iam inl. 10) referring to the
time which succeeded Falcula’s acquittal.

106.—20. redderet, also hypothetical subj. of action occurring in present
time: cp. n. on ἕ 63, and v. R. 1530 c, r. 638 c: the mood thus
used with the condition suppressed is called potential. R. 1534, r. 642.
rei iudicatae, praeiudiciis de Scamandro et Fabricio factis—MAN.
22. esse, after constitisse is not easy to explain. The pres. must denote
the permanent characteristic, ‘ is always ' : though this is a poetical use, as
Verg. A. viii. 141, (Maiam) idem Atlas generat, ‘is her father.' The
pres, with iam dudum is the nearest parallel in prose. Perhaps fuisse
should be read ; v. crit. n. 22. de statu, suo declinarint, ‘receded
from the position which they had occupied.' Status, a fixed position : as
in leg. agr. i. ἓ 26, si status hic rei publicae maneat. Cp. ἓ 190 11.
28. constantiam: cp. 1. 20, sibi constitisse, and Gloss. sub voc. con-
