case I would have pressed the point, and you
would have accepted my view. (ἐξ 159, 160) The
law binds you, and if Accius had thought a little,
he would not have suggested the contrary.

LXIII. (ἓ 176) Sassia at once began to plot. She bought of

shame they had to urge some besides mere prejudice.

, (ἕ 161) (α) It is said Cluentius' slaves attacked Decidius:

why, Cluentius was most generous to him! (b) that
they attacked the shepherds of Pacenus and
Ancharius ε it was a mere squabble 3 (ξ 162) (c) that he
was Aelius’ heres, to the exclusion of a nearer relative
—a high tribute to Cluentius' merit Ξ he had nothing
to do with making the will; (d) that he disputed a
legacy to Florus: nay, but he was at once cautious
and liberal. Ceius too he treated generously.
(ἓ 163) Ennius’ case is trumped up z I hear his charge
of assault is due to your subornation. I will handle
him in his turn. (ξ 164) And this is all they could
rake up in eight years !

(ἕ 165) And now we come to the real charge in the case,

that of poisoning‚ Ist, Vibius Cappadox ε that is easily
disproved ; and, 2d‚ (ξ 166) young Oppianicus, (ἓ 167)
a crime foreign to Cluentius’ whole career: impro-
bable in detail, and without motive. (§ 168) Besides,
the suggested victim Balbutius did not die as de-
scribed at all, but after an illness of some days.
[Father’s Deposition read]

(ξ 169) This last charge shows that it is the implacable

Sassia who is at the bottom of it all. The charge of
poisoning Oppianicus the elder through M. Asellius
is (ἓ 170) without any motive, either of fear or gain.
Hatred would have prompted him to leave his enemy

alive in his misery; (ἓ 171) death, unless we believe v*

sables about Hades, would have been a blessing3
(ξ 172) and what connection had he with Asellius?

Asellius was his foe and Oppianicus' friend. Why Δ

was he not prosecuted too? (ἓ 173) The mode of
giving the poison is very unlikely‚ and Oppianicus

(§§ 174 and 175) did not die suddenly, in fact, but of

a sall from his horse while still an invalid.
