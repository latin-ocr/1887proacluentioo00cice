patricians or plebeians) whose fathers or ancestors had held curule office
in the State. (V. Glossary, nobilitas, and n. on § 11, 1. 3,§ 72, l. 1.)
This new aristocracy of titled families was for a long time as exclusive and

time its serried phalanx was not unfrequently broken by some intruding
novus homo such as Marius and Cicero. (Cp. Mur. ἓ 17.) The novur
homo was the founder of a family—an zgrnobilis by birth, who had attaineo
curule office first of his family—a ‘ sels-made man.' Vell. ii. 34 has an

tical action ε rerum gerendarum d. is opposed to the studium rerum nova-
rum of the populares (Halm).
