inter allegatos, FM, for which Turnebus conjectured alligatos, The read-
ing in this passage has been hotly disputed by generations of scholars. (1)
inter allegatos, though undoubtedly false, has the support of Ramsay. It
has been explained 3 (a) by Manutius as=nocentes, ‘those whose names
were brought forward (by Avillius as informer).' But this use of the word
is post-Augustam as Ry. points out 3 (b) by Sylvius as=adlz2·bz'tos‚ ‘ called
in’ to murder Asuvius. Orelli's explanation is similar: ‘ eos qui ad Avil-
lium de occidendo Asuvio ab Oppianico adornati sunt': in fact ‘the
agents of Oppianicus.’ He connects inter allegatos with primum Opp.
nomen, ‘first among his own agents‚’ a construction like primus inter
pares-3 (c) Gronovius (ad Liv. xxxvi. 11) brings out the force of allega·
tos better3 allego being to ‘depute a person or persons to treat with
another person as internuntius ⁹ ε he states that allegati is a legal term for
‘persons employed to take down a deposition‚' who thereby are them-
selves constituted testes. (This he admits is not certain: his authority,
Isz'd. v. 23, has allzgratz'.) He connects inter allegatos with constabat.
(2) inter alligatos: ‘ criminis obnoxios‚' ‘ culpae adfines,’ according to
Turnebus. ‘ Among those implicated in the crime.' This meaning can
be amply illustrated (v, Glossary). But as Class. says, ‘ participium alli-
gati, quum non constet, quinam sint isti homines, abrupte nimis positum
videtur.’ Hence (mallis-catum, the reading of ST, Bait„ Kays., Kl.‚ Mun„
is the best, as being the clearest. ‘ Implicated '—testimonio obstrictum
