xxxv1i1. 107] CRITICAL NOTEs. 249

aliud si, conj. Halm, Bait. 7. constarent, Lamb. wishes to read
constaret, as also in de Dom. ἓ 139, quae si omnia e Ti. Coruncani
scientia . . . acta esse constarent. In Rosc. Am. ἓ 118, maleficiis quae
in illo constat esse is now read. Madv. quotes these passages on de Fin.
iii. ἓ 23, membra nobis ita data sunt ut ad quandam rationem vivendi
⁷ data esse appareant, but here the nature of the verb does not in itself
preclude a personal construction. (Of course it is the presence of the infin.
which constitutes the anomaly3 eg. ξ 125, dum haec de Oppianico con-
stabunt is perfectly regular). An ex. from Livy xli. 20. 2, ut nec sibi nec
aliis, quinam homo esset, constaret looks like a case of constare personal
with predicative extension, and the influence of analogy in determining
construction is not to be denied. I therefore keep constarent.

All our MSS. exhibit respondit, which cannot well be defended3 though
Miill. reads it, referring to ξ 27, 11011 . . . reformidat, sed . . . respondit,

‘this honourable court ' elsewhere, as in Caec. ἓ 38, si auctoritate virorum

vero . . . laudo. Mr. Davies (Hermathena, vol. ii. p. 399) would
transpose these words so as to follow maluerunt, and end the section.
He explains: ‘These [viz. those who voted Guilty]‚ who could by no
means aequit a man whom they had found out to be the worst of criminals,
and whom they had themselves virtually found guilty on two former
occasions, preferred to give a vote of condemnation, when such a bad
character was attached to the court, and the suspicion of such shocking
foul play, the facts of which were shortly afterwards made public; and
1 really commend the good sense of those who said that the case was not
clear to them‚’——apparently connecting patefacta with suspicio. The diffi-
culty, which Mr. Davies has rightly discovered, may be met otherwise
than by declaring the received text ‘ perfeetly unintelligible,’ and disturb-
ing the natural connection of paulo posterius patefacta re3 which also, in
its reference to the N. L. voters, accords admirably with the words of
