 

INTRODUCTION. xxvii

Not Proven, are not named in this speech.1——This gives
17 against, 15 for, which is the right division. But when
we come to examine ἕ 107, we shall find reason to pro-
pound the opinion that the names there given are those
of persons who voted Not Proven. This would give 18
against, 14 for:2 which cannot be reconciled with the state-
ment in the pro Caecina. We can only suppose that in ἓ 107
Cicero does not give all the names of those who voted Not
Proven, who were ten in all, not nine.3 This will make the
division 17 to 15.

ἓ 10. Such however is the version which the orator gives to
the facts of the iudicium Iunianum, in reply to the assertion
of the opposite side, that the seventeen jurors aforesaid were
bribed by Cluentius. We cannot but admire the genius,
which out of such sorry materials could create such a master-
piece of fancy 3 nowhere has Cicero shown more insight into
the springs of human action, or drawn more lifelike portraits‚
than in his description of the worthy trio, Staienus, Bulbus,
and Gutta. Of course this ingenious narrative must suffer
from a closer scrutiny. It will be well to invite the student's
attention to some points in it.

It is prefaced by a glaring fallacy, that of ἓ 64: if there
was bribery‚ it is argued, it must havelbeen employed either
by Cluentius or Oppianicus: the third alternative, that it
was employed by both, being quietly ignored. It is also
assumed as self-evident that the conviction of Oppianicus
must follow when the conviction successively of Scamander
and Fabricius had preceded, the jurors being bound by these
praeiudicia, which were of their own making. This again is

2 cle. 9vote N. L. ε 5 Not Guilty : 8 vote Guilty : 10 remain, who must
also have voted Guilty. V. n. on ἓ 106.

3 This seems better than to suppose (with Peterson) that Cicero is quoting
a certain number of names from the list both of those who voted N. L.
and those who voted C. The tone of the passage precludes us from
supposing that the names are not those of persons in the same’category.

Zumpt (ii. 2. 128) suggests that for a decisive verdict it may have been
essential that the number of N. L. voters should be no more than one·
third of the whole number ι in this instance less than 1 1 out of 32. (This
is a mere conjecture, on the analogy of a provision in the lex Acilia.)
Thus 10 vote N. L., 5 Not Guilty: the other 17 vote Guilty. (This is
Niemey r’s view, Progr. Kiel, 1871.)

' Klotz (luban, p. 219, in Scimmtl. Reden Cic.) says that 32 jurors, with
the exception of five, found Opp. guilty. Probably he mistook the sense
of ξ 106, condemnare . . . paulo posterius maluerunt, where v. n.
