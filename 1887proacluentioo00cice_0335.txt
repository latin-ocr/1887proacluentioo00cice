LXVI. 189] CRITICAL NOTES. 271

³< vobis, two MSS. nobis. It is to the jury that the depositions are communi-

cated. Pago 71, l. 2. primum, ST b (corn), wanted to answer to
post: primam, R. aliquod dictum adiungere, ST ; aliquid adiungere
dietum, R. In choosing between qui and quis, aliqui and aliquis, it is
best to be guided solely by the best MS. authority. V. ἓ 7 (where the
same variant occurs), explan. n.: the grammatical line between the
respective forms is not a hard and fast one. Madv. (de Fz‘n. ii. ἓ 109)
has unnecessarily abandoned all MSS. in reading aliud aliquod. Cp. his
note on quae quidque (v. l. quodque) efficiat, z’b. i. ξ 18: in which he
refers to Classen’s correction here (from ST). But here the grammatical
question does not really arise z with the reading of ST, dictum is a subst.‚
with that of R, a participle. Font. §40 supports ST, ne dictum quidem
aliquod reprehenderunt. 4. per dolorem, ST; Bait. , Kays., Miill.,
Kl.; dolore, R, Or., Ry., Class. 5. suspicio, ST ; suspicione, R.
6. iudicarat, almost all MSS. ; indicarat, R; Lamb., Or.

185.—10. et de eo, conj. Halm. 13. aliqua, ST ; in aliqua, R.

LXVI. 17. quaestionem . . . ipsam, om. T. 18. obsignarit, almost
all MSS. ; obsignavit, R ; {Lamb., Or. nominatim, ST; nominat,
M; nominate, F (Ρ). In this sentence 1 adopt the palmary conj. of
Baiter: dicite qui (codd. quis) obsignarit unum aliquem nominatim ;
so Kays., Kl., Miill. The existence of the variant obsignavit perhaps
confirms this. For though good edd. have read ‘dicite, quis obsig-
navit? it is quite unlike Cic.‚ who would have said, ‘dicite quis
obsignarit,' and might have said ‘ dicite qui obsignavit unum aliquem.'
The genesis of the false readings would then be ε d. qui obszgrnavz‘t u. al. ;
this, being Wrongly punctuated, gives dicite quis obszgnavzr ,9 and this again,
dicite quis obsignarit.

186.—23. auctoritatem, Tand others. 24. de, ST ; ex, R. So§ 175.
26. For nihil, Sylv. conj. aliquid, Passerat. conj. nonnihil, which
Lamb. and Gar. approved. But V. explan. n. : this is not a concessz'on,
as they understood it. 28. servata, ST 3 reservata, R. Re· is
falsely inserted in ξ 20, retineretur (ST), ἓ 21, renuntiavit (M): falsely
omitted, ξ 24, nuntiant (ST) ἓ 83 quaerebant (S) ἓ 159 putare (all but
ST). 29. Strat. et Nicostrato, Pluygers brackets : so Kays.

187.-—31. quem tu cum, om. S. 32. iudicandi, FM and others·
A frequent confusion, ἕ 184: cp. ἓ 82, vobis indicibus. 33. servare
before mg, om, T, Pago 72, 1. 5. omneS, om. T. 6. servi, ST ;
Bait., Kays.; servili, M and others3 servuli, Lamb. and other edd.
Miill. conj. emorientis, not badly: cp. ξ 30 n.

188.-22. cognosset (or cognoscet), STFM ; cognosceret, R.
After sedemque a few MSS. read coniugii which Class. and Ry. bracket,
later edd. omit.

189.-29. si, ST; Class. and subsequent edd. except Ry. who reads
nisi with R. Man. conj. ni: and this (or nisi) is the easier, but not
therefore the preferable reading. With nisi (ni) the clause means,
