worship of Venus in her temple on Mount Eryx, on the N.W. coast
of Sicily, was kept up by a number of persons of both sexes, who
had further to administer the landed property belonging to the founda-
tion, and who seem to have been at least one degree removed above
a state of slavery.’—P. 20. familia, v. Glossary. 21. detondere, ‘to
maintain, ' = defendendi causa dicere : an instance of a verb used pregnantly ε
so turbare bellumzturbando efficere, excusarezexcusando dicere, munire
viam=muniend0 facere. A separate transitive notion‚ which governs
the object, is included in each of these verbs, V. Nagelsb. Stil. ξ 102.
(But Prof. Nettleship doubts the pregnant use: d. h0c=‘1 defend this
point,’ so with acc. and infin. ⁴ maintain this, that . . .') 22. decunones,
n. on ἕ 41. 25. pro loco, ‘ considering his position.' 26. If se be

Archytam scripsit Plato, non sibi se soli natum meminerit, sed patriae, sed

ἡμῶν οὐχ αὑτᾷ μόνον γέγονεν, ἀλλὰ τῆς ’γενέσεως ἡμῶν τὸ μέν τι ἡ πατρςὶ
μερίζεται, τό δέ τι οἱ γεννήσαντες, τό δὲ οἱ μλοιποὶ φίλοις 01· perhaps in

draw Cluentius from the case of the Martiales’; quam pro Larinatibus
contra Martiales agebat.—MAN. demovere, by poisoning him (ἓ 45 ad
sin. ) a sort of euphemism. interest and refert are generally constructed
with adverbs of value (such as maxime), but occasionally take the gen.
(locative) of value. Verr. ii. 3. 99, magni sua putabant interesse.
