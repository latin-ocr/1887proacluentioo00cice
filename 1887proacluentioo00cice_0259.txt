111. THIRD DrvrsioN or THE CASE.--DEAL1NG wrm THE ‘ CR1M1NA '
AGAINST CLUENTms, on ACTUAL CHARGES 01.- P01soN1NG.

(a) ATTACK ON DEcmms AND OTHERs.

LIX.—161.-—31. familia=familia servorum=servis (Ry.). V. Gloss.
Hence ab is used. For calamitate v, Gloss. dixistis : on the plural ν.
crit. n. Pago 63, 1. 2. vfflcum: v. crit. n. for the use of the sing.
3. attulisse depends on dixistis. cambus : v· crit. n. with ref. Callis (con-
nected perhaps with Ahar of κέλομαι, cel-er) is especially used of cattle-
tracks on the upland pastures t nos hic pecorum modo per aestivos saltus
deviasque callis 'exercitum ducimus, Liv. xxii. 14. 8. In the plural, the
word is applied to the mountain pastures of Samnium (overlooking
Campania, Liv. l.c.)‚ Apulia, and Calabria, which in fact stretched along
nearly the whole of the Adriatic coast. The ‘ silvae callesque‚' or ‘ woods
and forests,' formed the provincia of a quaestor, stationed apparently at
Brundisium, in imperial times. Tac. Ann. iv. 27 (though some would
read Cales there). 6. illis, ‘the other party‚' that of Decidius.
discessum est, ‘the disputants parted.' Cp. aequo Marte discedere.

(b) CLUENTIUS Gor HIMSELF MADE HEIR To AELms ι OTHER
MISDEEDS.

162.—7. P. Aeli . . . institutus est: the words of the prosecution.
8. memor : the comparative is absolutely used, as in res maiores, ‘matters
of great importance,’ senior, ⁴ an elderly man,’ etc. It denotes the pre-
sence of the given quality in a lzz'gh degree : ‘ more of a stranger than he⁴
might have been,’ z'.e. ‘ a perfect stranger.’ Not as Ρ., ‘ a distant eonnec-
tion,’ z'.e. ‘ more of a stranger than the propinquuS.' 8. Habiti merito ι
an abl. of attendant circumstance with genitive as attribute. Cp. meritis·
simo eius quae volet faciemus. Plaut. Asin. iii. 3. 1473 R. 1242, 1244;
r. 504. So meo periculo, ‘ at my risk‚’ tuo commodo, ‘if convenient to
you.' ‘ Cluentius had a claim on P. Aelius for what he did.' 1 1. 111-
fitiatum esse, ‘he refused to allow' the legacy due. It is a technical
term : infitiator is ‘ one who denies his obligation to pay a certain sum,'
e.g. de Or. i. ξ 168, si ille infitiator probasset iudici ante petitam esse pecu-
niam quam esset coepta deberi. Festus explains infitiari, ‘ creditum
fraudari.' Iuv. Sat. xiii. 60, nunc si depositum non infitietur amicus.
12. ei, of course Florus : depending on cautum. ‘ The title of Florus'was,
in Cluentius's opinion, insufficient.' cautum, by the terms of the will,
which contained a clerical error, 30,ooo sestertii for 300‚000 sestertii.
The cumbrous Roman notation must have led to many such errors.
Modern editors distinguish decern sestertii, decem sestertia, decies

sestertium, thus, HS X, HS rc, HSX ε but the ancients allow the reader to
