212 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [LXVI. 190

n. z and for the description of the house, ἓ 27, domum viri sui sanguine
redundantem.

190. —Page ¹73, l. 3. donis muneribus: cp. crit. n. on ἓ 66, tantum
donis datis muneribusque perfecerat, for this legal phrase, ‘gifts and
donations,’ the latter of the two being the more specific term.

LXVII. 5. For this use of quod to point a contrast, cp. 5 28, ita
quod ceteri propter liberos pecuniae cupidiores solent esse, ille propter
pecuniam liberos amittere iucundum esse duxit, with note. 7. discidia,
never to be spelt dz'ffsszdza (as often in the older edd„ even in such a
passage as Balb. ἓ 30, dissidentem a populo Romano odio quodam atque
discidio). It 1s properly the snappz'ng (discindo) of a tie. vidimus:
for the tense v. crit. n. 11. adflnitatis coniunctionem answers to the
cognate construction which appears in, ag„ nuptiae sceleris societate
coniunctae, ἕ 35 : ‘ Believed that the bonds of a marriage tie would be a
guarantee for the perpetuation of ill-will.’

191‚—13. compararet, ‘ procure²: armaret, ‘equip.’ 14. minis
et promissis, cp. ξ 176, et spe et metu: ‘ Overtures to slaves alike by
threat and promise.' 16. aliquando, ‘at length’: cp. ξ 25, and the
opening words of Catil. ii. , tandem aliquando, Quirites, L. Catilinam*

. . eiecimus. modus, here almost subjective (zmodestia). ‘No
scruple on her part.' The phrase sine modo modestiaque (Sall. and
Liv.) may be compared, ‘ without limit or restraint.’ Cp. also ἓ 96 (in
illo iudicio) non modus ullus est adhibitus. For auctoritas v. Gloss.
18. falsae conscriptiones quaestionum, ‘ spurious depositions at the ex-
aminations,’ viz. those of Strato and Nicostratus, ἓ 182. 20. totius
denique, cet., ‘this whole accusation, as it has been got up, is hers both
in its conception and in its presentation.’ This section shouldbe com-
pared with§ 18.

192.—22. his rebus instructum, ‘ thus armed.’ 23. conquirendorum

. . causa, ‘in order to get together and engage witnesses.’ Cp. ad. Fam.
iii. 11. 3, mercennarii testes. 26. diligentia, ‘ vigilance,’ ἓ 3, diligentia
vestra nobis adiungenda est, with note. 27. aut ne forte, cet., ‘or, it
may be, lest her maternal eyes should miss the sight on which they longed
to feast, her son's woeful aspect and garb of mourning.' Cp. ἓ 18,
squalore huius et sordibus laetatur: Becker’s Gallus, sc. viii. (Chresimus
to Gallus), ‘ hear the counsel of a faithful servant. Divest yourself of all
the insignia of the distinction befitting your rank. Throw carelessly
round you the worst and oldest toga you can find, and publicly display
the sorrow with which the interdict has filled you.' ‘H0w,’ retorted
Gallus, ‘ humble myself and go about in dirty garments like a criminal,
and beg for mercy !' Such was the mourning adopted at Rome, whether
in times of bereavement or of peril from a heavy accusation: the sufferet
assumed the sordida vestis (vestem mutavit), let his hair grow, and
discarded all decorations.

LXVIII. 30. ‘ But imagine, if you can, that journey of hers to Rome.'
