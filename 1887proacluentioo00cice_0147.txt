ΙΙ. 6] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 83

vellet . . . labefactabit . . . extorquebit . . . ‘ Convellere is to pluck
away by a straight pull3 labefactare, to shake an object backwards and
forwards, and so loosen its hold of anything to which it may be attached 3
extorquere is to wrench out by a twist. Thus if we wished to pull a
· stake from the ground, we should first attempt ‘ convellere '3 if this failed
we should proceed ‘labefactare'; and finally, if still unsuccessful, ‘ex-
torquere' The same processes would be applied if we wished to deprive
a person by violence of anything which he was grasping firmly (compre-
hendebat). In the next clause remittatis means ‘let go your hold’
(Ramsay). The separate force of the words is well given: but there is
no climax in the verbs, convello being fully as forcible a term as extorqueo .·
and Professor Nettleship notes that convello and labefacto are nearly
synonymous in Rab. Perd. ἓ 3, cum cuncta auxilia reipublicae labefactari ⁷
convellique videat. 30. ne repugnetis: dependent on postulo (1. 24),
primum . . . deinde . . . tum . . . giving the three parts of his demand.
We need not, with Kiihner, consider this an instance of a Pres. Subj.
2d Person, expressing a prohibition to a definite person or persons.
This is a common construction in the Comic Poets, occurs once in Hor.
(Serm. ii. 3. 88, ne sis patruus mihi), and once only (in a more than doubt—
sul case—cp. Cluent. ἓ 30, l. 21), in Cic. (ad Att. xiv. 1, tu quaeso, quic—
quid novi, scribere ne pigrere), but is ‘otherwise unknown. The same
rule holds as to the Pres. Subj. 2d Person of command to a definite
person: it is only thus used in the Comedians and in Cicero’s Letters‚
ag. ad Att. i. 17. 11, te si expectari velis, cures ut sciam. From the
instances given, it is plain that in both cases this exceptional usage was
colloquial, and not permitted in strict writing. R. 1600, n., r. 668, a.
Cp. Cluent. l.e., ξ 135, consideres censeo· 31. eamque . . .
remittatis: a dependent subj. of command carried on from the depen—
dent prohibition ne repugnetis. Similarly in Eur. Bacclz. 343, οὐ μὴ
προσοίσεις χεῖρα, βακχεύσεις δ’ ἰών; a command grows out of a pro-
hibition. For aque, cp. note on ac, l. 273 and cp. Hor. C. iii. 30. 6,
non omnis moriar multaque pars mei {vitabit Libitinam. After
a negative sentence, where English requires an adversative particle,
Latin frequently uses the copulative et, qne, ac, atque. By the use of
the latter the two sentences are placed upon the same footing: the
former would be corrective, superseding the first by the second. Szcll.
ἓ 36, qui vitam hominum . . . non nossent ac tantum audissent eos pari
calamitate esse. R. 2200, r. 862, Madv. 433. 2. Similarly we find et
non, ac non, after a positive clause, R. 2235.1 aut . . . aut . ,¹⁸.
‘either . . . or at any rate . . . ’ 2 So Tusc. Dz'sp. i. 11. 25,

1 Cp. Dr. Holden's note, Plane. ἓ 70.
2 V. Prof. Wilkins on de Orat. ii. § 18. 1”)ι[·.2 ii. §343‚ l.c. α, denies that this is a

separate usage—quoting Tusc. i. 3, ut non multum aut nihil omnino Graecis cederetur.

Here however the second alternative is stronger and demands assent : ‘ Very little, if
anything at all!
