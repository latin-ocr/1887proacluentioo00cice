eoflt, many others. 19. intersit, ST 3 interest, R. 22. idem, .
ST 3 stem, R. 24. inve, TF, and others ; in, S ; quive in, R ; a
reminiscence of the earlier part of the section.

149.—27. noluit, T 3 Lamb. Miill.; nolit, R, Class.‚ Ry.‚ Kl.‚ MSS. often
confuse indic. and subj. ; e. g. ξ 107 fecerunt, ἓ 1 18 possim, ἓ 122 adepti sunt,

Ξῖ · § 144 videbantur, with variants. Here the indie. is better ι ‘ whatever else

he may be, he is at all events (tamen) one who has refused to shelter him-
self behind the terms of the law ' ε the plain statement of a fact. Cp. the
words of ἓ 145, qua hic me uti noluit. Classen punctuates with a mark
of interrogation at nolit instead of at Cluentius: arguing that the words
qui . . . nont are inadequate as an answer to the question ε but that the
question, if they form part of it, is unanswerable, and as such, an apt
conclusion of the argument. ‘Who then z's this Cluentius (who is no
magistrate, etc.)‚ although he refuses to stand on the terms of the law?
why, he lege non tenetur.' This is strained: and again, such rhetorical
questions are uncommon in ancient oratory, which generally answers its
own questions. Cp. ἓ 137 n. 31. se, om. ST. But sua. . . se
answer to mea . . . me in next line. Pago 58, l. 1. From dicenda
est to quae tunc (ἓ 154), M is wanting. 6. emm, T; Kays., Mull. ;
ego, R and other edd. 7. te a me desiderare, ST; Class.‚ Kl. If
with Class. we referred te to Accius, we should have to suppose the
words to be ironical, ‘the refutation which you seem so anxious to meet.’
But the sudden transition from Cluentius to Accius, even supposing the
orator to make some gesture in explanation, is almost impossible, especially
as the voc. Acci only appears in the next sentence. For the confusion
of the act. and pass. infinitives, cp. ἓ 122111.

LV. 15o.—-11. eiusmodi, ST; huius modi, R. 13. recusavit ne
eum, Bait. conj., Kays.; accusavit ut cum, codd„ so Class.‚ Ry.;
recusavit quin quo, Lamb. and Kl. ; recusavit ne quo, Miill.. Below
Ry. (under protest) reads with Lamb. and Or. uti non oportere, which
seems to be simply a conjecture of Man. Mr. Peterson in a note defends
the MSS. reading. But the gain to the sentence in clearness and point is
very great, if we read recusavit, [cp. recusatio in ξ 148, init.] and quo,
while the change from ut· to ne may be defended by their not infrequent
confusion in the MSS„ ag. in ξ 170, and Mur. ξ 11 ad fin. If we
retained ut«, we should need the non of Manutius below: for we can
hardly suppose with Class.‚ that after recuso Cic. would use ut c. subj., as
the equivalent of the simple infin. even when explanatory of lzoc: how-
ever, ν. explan. n. on ξ 16, esse faciendum. . . ut. 22. summum,
ST; in summum, F. In§ 110 we have in locum ascendere, and else-
where ad: the simple accus. is wanted for petiverunt here, and may be
paralleled from Font. ἓ 4, quae facilius possit Alpes quam paucos aerarii
gradus ascendere. The intrans. construction is commoner.

151.—33. qua. est nsua, Manutius’ fine emendation of the MSS. reading
quaestus or questus. Lamb. expunged the whole clause, supposing it
