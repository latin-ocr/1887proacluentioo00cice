xii INTRODUCTION.

uS, by the skill with which they are introduced, of the style of
Cicero's later philosophical works.

Lastly‚ for passion and scathing irony few passages in the
whole range of literature will compare with the magnificent
bursts of eloquence which are to be found in this speech, such
as the denunciation of Sassia's marriage with her son-in-law
(ἕ 15), and the peroration in which she is held up to detesta-
tion as ‘the wife of her son-in-law, thev illicit rival of her
daughter, the stepmother of the son of her womb.'

that the Cluentiana ‘is not a favourable specimen of Cicero's
oratorical power : there is no connection in the events 3 there
is no order of time. We are hurried from date to date, from
place to place. The same person is described under different
names 3 the same incident in different words. The result is a
mass of threads so knotted, twisted, and entangled, that only
patient labour can sort thern out into intelligible arrange-
ment.'1 There may be much intricacy in the story which
Cicero tells 3 confusion there is none, and those critics who
find it are merely finding what they have themselves intro-
duced. ’

The historical value of the speech cannot be exaggerated.
It is in Tact unique in this respect, that it gives us a glimpse,
which cannot elsewhere be obtained, of the life and morals of
a provincial town of Italy in the last century of the Republic.
We know something about the moral and social condition of ’
the capital from various contemporary sources, which are too
familiar to need enumeration. Sallust (totake one instance)
tells us how the nobler vice of ambition was succeeded by a
lust for gold, and a passion for sels-indulgence, which bred
crimes scarcely human ; from him we may learn that at Rome
reformed institutions and laws were powerless to arrest moral
decay—‘quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?' (Hor.
C. iii. 24. 35.) But the story of Cluentius and Oppianicus is
a most valuable supplement to this. As it was in Rome, so it
was in Italy. If Rome had a Sempronia, an Aurelia Orestilla,
a Fulvia,2 Larinum had a Sassia, as wicked and as beautiful as
they. The virtue of old Italy was as obsolete as that of old
Rome. Sulla himself could not repair what he had done as
