C. OPPIANICUS’ TRIAL.

XXII.—27. persona, ‘ character' 3 v. Glossary, and critical note.
29. praeludium, ‘ previous decisions ’ 3 v, Glossary. 30. Fabr101orum:
only C. was concerned, L. being dead (ἐξ 46, 47). But the plural (of
vague expression) is used to include Scamander. As a libertus of the
Fabricii he might take their name. In ἓ 62 Cic. uses the sing.
Fabricium. 31. loeus . . . constitutus, ξ 56, l. 20, n.

6o.—Page 23, 1. 5. si . . . condemnassent . . . consentire . . .
debuerunt3 an apparently irregular conditional sentence: in reality the
infin. with the modal verb debuerunt is equivalent to the plup. subj. con·
sensissent, and is substituted for it. Another substitute is sut. participle
with fui or eram. So in the pass. we have the plup. subj. replaced by
the gerundive with sui. These substituted forms differ from the ordinary
forms in expressing positive duty, intention, probability, etc.: where the
apodosis is dependent on some particle which takes the subj.‚ the substituted
form is, as a rule, preferred, that the subj. may not have double duty to do.
Thus a sentence like Sest. ξ 62, quod ille si repudiasset, dubitatis quin ei
vis esset adlata? (for adferenda fuerit) is very exceptional. Madv. ἓ 381.
Cp. Bradley's Arn. §461-(R. 1564-1570‚ r. 652). 8. rescinderent, as also
absolverent, liberarent below (11. 12, 14) is a dubitative subj. (subj. inter-
rogative of a command) in past time. We have a kindred usage in ξ 90,

exspectasset (ubi v, n.)‚ and to take a case of an imperfi, Liv. xlv. 37. 4, ·

non triumphum impediri debuit sed postero die . . . nomen deferrem in
these the subj. is assertive of a command given in past time. The two
appear together in a line of plaut„ C. non ego illi argentum redderem?
M. non redderes.-—Tr. 133. 10. minister inmalefieio . . . conscius . . .‚
‘ instrumental in his crime . . . an accessory to it.'

61.-14. illa iudicia. senatoria, ‘the senatorial juries of the day.’
Originally the juries for quaestiones perpetuae were taken from the sena-
torial order. In B.C. 122, the privilege of serving on juries was trans-
ferred by C. Gracchus to the party of his own creation, the equestrian
order: this was by the lex Sempronia iudiciaria. Successive attempts
were made by the Senate to recover the privilege: eg. the lex Servilia
of B.C. 106 (ἓ 140). But it was only in B.C. 81 that they recovered it
absolutely, by the lex Cornelia of L. Sulla. The Senate in general
abused it in favour of corrupt provincial governors z the condemnation of
Verres came too late to retrieve the credit of that order : and in B.C. 70,
the lex Aurelia of Cotta vested the privilege in three orders jointly—the
Senate, Equites, and Tribuni aerarii (the last named being clerks or
treasury officials whose sunction it was to receive and disburse the tribu·
