158 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xxxvm. 107

scius. 32. paulo posterius patefacta re condemnare maluerunt:
contrast primo, § 76, 1. 22, ‘at the first hearing.’ The words are not
intended to imply that a second hearing ever came in the case of Opp.
[Mr. Roby tr. ‘ preferred to put off condemnation to some later occasion,
when the facts were made clear.’ Mr. Davies has taken the words
quite differently: V. crit. n.] Comparing the language of this and the
following section (especially the expressions sapientes, ex vetere illa iudicum
disciplina, ll. 1, 11, below) with that of the beginning of ἓ 76, we cannot
but identify those who voted non liquet with the nine men here named.
(Ry. Introd. p. 18, note 2, supposes the latter to have voted guilty.) Five
acquitted (ἓ 76). Eight voted guilty, and were suspected of or charged
with venality afterwards. There were thirty-two jurors in all (ἕ 74). Thus
ten more must have voted guilty; and the numbers were 14 (9-l-5) for
Opp., 18 against him : if we may judge from the pro Cluent. alone. But
this result is inconsistent with a statement in pro Caec. ἕ 29: V. Introd.

107.——Page 41, l. 3. For the triplet arrangement of the epithets pru-
dentior, peritior, diligentior aut sanctior, ep. n. on ἓ 15: Balbus is
the shrewd thinker, the well-read lawyer, and the virtuous juror in one.
The same arrangement appears in the words fide, religione, officio ι and in
the threefold question (ll. 5-7) about Considius. iure peritior: but l. 6,
dignitatis peritior. The latter is the regular construction: of the former
I can find no other ex, in Cic.; here the abl. is used for the sake of
symmetry with the other ablatives, is in fact abl. of ‘thing in point
of which ’ attached to peritior as it might be to any other adj. Cp. iure
consultus for iuris consultus (the commonet usage). R. 1210, r. 497 ,ε for
the gen., which is objective, R. 1314, r. 525. 4. Non absolvit: non
condemnat, the other side might say. But Cic. is making the most of his
case. Were he speaking (as Ry. thinks) of those who voted guilty, he
would certainly say condemnat outright, with no litotes. 8. long-um
est: for the mood cp. ἓ 36, longum est dicere mihi, with note. On
the reading of this sentence v. crit. n. 10. Ex vetere iila iudicum
disciplina, cp. ἓ 76, homines . . . ex vetere illa disciplina, with
note. fuit: [nam] obierat.—MAN. 12. ‘Who had, each one of
them, achieved in the law-courts an eminence like that of the country to
which he belonged.' 13. Ex eodem numero: an attraction for ex
eorundem numero. So ex eo numero, in eo nurnero (far commoner than
in eorum numero, according to Mayor, Phil. ii. ἓ 25). Cp. Verr. ii. 4.
3, ex quo potius numero [incipiam] quarn ex ipsis laudatoribus tuis? Sall.
lug. xxxviii., ex eo numero quos . . . corruptos diximus. Similar attrac-
tions are ea gratia=eius rei gratia (Sall. Ing. lxxX.) ea scientia, de Fin. i.
ἓ 63. 16. ingenio et diligentia. et religione ε cp. what was said os
Balbus at the beginning of the section.

108.—18. in: ep. n. on ἓ 32, l. 25: §78‚ similis in Bulbo . . . sus·
picio consistebat. 19. ambitiosus : cp. ambitione adducti, 5 76 ad fin.
