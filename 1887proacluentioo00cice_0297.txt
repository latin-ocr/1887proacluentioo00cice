xw. 47] CRITICAL NoTEs. 23 3

‹lucei-03 Miiller, neque [enim] legare q. e. m. m. poterat [in] animum
inducere. But quicquam has no MS. support, and in only that of some
inferior MSS.

XVI. 46.—14. Aletrinati, Priscian (vii. '14. 70) 3 Larinati, ST 3 Ale-
trinate, FM. In §49 three codd. Lagomarsiniani read a Larinatibus.
Throughout Halm prefers the form Alatrinates, which I adopt from him.
19. Iam: Madv. conjectures nam. ‘ Confirmatur enim quod praecedit,
non praeparatur novae rei commemorati03 cp. ἓ 57, altero loco correxit
Pluygersius‚' Advers. iii. p. 128. But in both these cases, as in ἓ 67 also,
iam introduces a new presentation of a fact already stated. It is enforced
by a neuter pronoun. So in ἓ 87, ἓ 109, qa). 22. iiS, ST 3 his, FM.
24. studiose, STF and others3 studio, M, codd. Pall., cod. S. vict„
cod. Dresd„ Franc. secund. : a variant easily accounted for.

47.—29. non ignobili, ST and another 3 Kays.‚ Kl., Mun. 3 ignobili,
R., Ry., Bait. 31. et, ST, cod. S. Vict.; sed, R3 Ry. insists that
non incallidus is an expression of reproach‚ the qualification of which
must be introduced by sed. Even granting the former point, the latter does
not follow. Cicero often uses the conjunctive particles (et, -que, ac) to
explain, where we use a disjunctive particle ‘ but ' to oppose: Sull. ἓ 21,
in quo ego imperavi nihil, et contra . . . parui 3 de Off i. §22, non nobis
solum nati sumus ortusque nostri partem patria vindicat. Page 18,
1. 1. collocutu8‚ ST3 locutus, R. Bebio, ST3 Baebrio, most other
codd. In ξ 53 M gives Baevius 3 two codd. Lagomarsiniani Baebius, which
Gar. adopts 3 cp. in Pis. 588. 3. qua diligentia, Sb (corr.), codd.
Lambini, Baiter, Kays.‚ Klotz 3 quanta diligentia, T 3 qua dignitate,
R; adopted by Ry., who explains it as meaning ‘ Baebius was a man of
high standing, whose advice might therefore be safely followed.' 6.
multa, ST, Lamb. 3 multis, R, Ry. 7. comparatur, ST 3 om. FM.
8. pecunia, ST 3 pecuniaque, R. ob, STFM 3 ad, many inferior codd.
6-9. Ramsay reads: Ne multis3 Diogenes emitur ; venenum diebus paucis
(multi viri boni²quum ex occulto intervenissent) pecuniaque obsignata,
quae ad eam rem dabatur, in manibus Scamandri, liberti Fabriciorum,
deprehenditur. So Or. Bait.‚ Kays.‚ Kl., Mtill. follow ST.

We must compare ἓ 49, euius in manibus venenum deprehenderat 3 ἓ 5 3,
Scamandrum curn veneno pecuniaque deprehensum. If we are to make a
consistent story out of these passages, we must suppose (in spite of Classen)
that both the poison and the purchase·money were found upon Scamander.
[V. explan. n. for force of dabatur] As Ry. says, the money without the
poison would have been no proof of guilt 3 and (ἓὲ 50, 56) the deprehensio
veneni was the grand charge against Scamander. Cicero may mean that ·
Scamander had received the poison from Diogenes, and was on the point
of paying for it when the witnesses rushed on him.

Ry.'s reading no doubt is the clearest statement of the circumstances.
But we have no right to insist on so clear a statement in sace of the MSS.
If the statement in the true reading is confused, it is either because Cic. feels
