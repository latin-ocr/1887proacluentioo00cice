ωαχ. 198] CericAL NoTEs. 273

opprimendum illum ' ε illa then: ‘that way.’ The correction in the text
is Miiller's, the most satisfactory because the clearest: 2’ll2·m=‘from
Larinum. '—Ern. had bracketed Larino. 3. possit, Bait„ Kays.‚ after
seven inferior codd. ε posset R.

194.-,-12. nostrorum, all Mss. but two: nostrum, Class„ Ry.‚ Bait.
Both forms are used, being genitive plur. of noster, to supply a gen. plur.
of nos (as is also nostri, gen. sing. of noster): the former however is not
elsewhere found in Cic. , though occasionally occurring in the comic poets.
Kl. quotes Pl. Poen. iv. 2. 39, nam nostrorum nemo dignus est: Liv.
viii. 9, divi quorum est potestas nostrorum hostiumque. Gellius sayS,
‘vostrorum multifariam seriptum est pro vostrum xx. 6. 12. Probably
in Cicero's time a colloquialism. 15. putet, all MSS. but three, Bait.

⁴No reasonable explanation could be given of a subj. here. In ἓ 155 (for

tenetur) ἓ 30 (for fuit) we have instanees of the confusion of subj. and
indic. in good Mss. 20. a suis aris atque templis nefarias preces
aspernatos deos esse confido, quoted by Arusianus, p. 216.

LXIX. 195.—22. quasi aliquos, Halm conj. : quos alios, T: alios, S
and many inferior codd. : quosdam alios, Lamb., Or. , Class., Ry., ex-
plained by Ry. ‘ a peculiar body of deities, different from the gods whom
men in general worship,’ which would be tasteless exaggeration z in prose
the metaphor deos requires to be sostened, not sharpened. Class. had
already conjectured quasi from quos of T. 25. parentium, T, which
would not be the ordinary gen. of this word, except in poetry. But -ztm
appears, Rosc. Am. ξ 67, Verr. ii. V. ἐξ 23, 130, 138: Plane. ἓ 28:
Kiihner, i. ἓ 77, 10, for other reff. ; yet parentium, Off i. ἓ 118. 33. in
communi Italiae pace domesticis copiis esse tutum, Lamb., Or. All
MSS. have communi 1. p. in dom. cop. e. totum, which Class. and Ry.
replace, but no other modern ed. It was first amended in the Aldine ed.
The conclusive correction of in domesticis to non dom., adopted by
Kays.‚ Mun„ Kl.‚ is Madvig's. ln and non are sometimes confused in
MSS., ag. Sull. ἓ 77, si z'n (al. non) extremo discrimine fortuna deseret.

196.—-Page 75, l. 4. unius ε illiue, Τ. 11. assequantur, S. Even
the best MSS. sometimes confuse sing. and plur. , the stroke denoting n being
easily lost. 14. After adsurgite many edd. have LAVDA'rio CLVENTII
Ex DECVRIONVM LARINATIVM DECRETO, taken from Lamb.'s Ms.

197.—17. quam incr-ed. . . . cura est, om. F. 18. laudationem
decretam, St laudationum decreta, R. 20. Frentani, F, Or.‚ Ry.‚
Class. In their territory, which formed the littoral of Samnium, Larinum
lay: now the S. E. part of the Abruzzo Citra. V. reff. in L. and Sh. :
add Flor. i. 18. 7. 23. Boiano, all Mss.

198. ——26. pecuniarias, all MSS., Lamb., Ry.‚Class.: corrected by Fulvius
Ursinus to pecuarias, on the ground that Samnium was a great grazing-
ground (especially after its depopulation by Sulla, v. Momms. iii. p. 342).
Quinct. ἓ 12, erat ei pecuaria res ampla. 29. his: iis, ST, Bait. So
ἓ 118, ST have eius sor lzuz'us .· the confusion is not uncommon.
