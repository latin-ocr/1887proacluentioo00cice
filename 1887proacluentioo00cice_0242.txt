forms have it, to perform.' 10. contra dicere: contra Sacerdotem d.—
ΜΛΝ. Equivalent to accusare in Val. Max.; v, first n. on this section.
usurum esse, ‘ was free to make use of.’ The fut. sometimes conveys
a mild command (‘ utetur ’ in or. recta) z especially in the second person ε

12. equum traducere, ‘to lead past’ ε non enim adimere equum voluit,

best explained, with Manutius and Ry., ‘ if Habitus lzgd been treated by the
censors as Sacerdos was—had not been stigmatised when there was neither
accuser nor witness forthcoming against him.' Facere, vicariously used,
may even take the place of verbs such as esse and pati: v.'L. and Sh.
facere ii. E, and cp. Hor. Serm. i. 1. 64, quid facias illi? iubeas miserum
esse, libenter Ι quatenus id facit, z'.e. miser est. So here hocfacere=r00ro
πάσχειν. Mr. Peterson explains, ‘ if he had been accorded the privilege
of defending himself ’ ; apparently taking it as= ‘to 'do this.' But
Sacerdos had not ‘defended himself.’ 15. ‘ Might easily, even with
the censors for his judges, have countervailed groundless insinuations and
the prejudice which demagogues had set on foot.' For this sense of
populares cp. Sest.§ 114, videtis populum ipsum . . . iam non esse popu·

VIII. EIGHTHLY: THE W1LL OF EGNA‘rms.

135.-18. elogium here: ‘ a clause in a will‚’ Properly it denotes any
‘ short saying ' (el0g2·are= ‘ describe briefly') t so de Fz'n. ii. ἓ 116, elogia
monumentorum, ‘ epitaphS.' Ry. quotes Pl. Merc. 403, impleantur
elegiarum meae sores carbonibus, ‘amatory compliments’ chalked by a
lover on the door of his mistress. We find it often mis-spelt eulogium or
edogium, as though it came directly from the Greek. ‘Elogium autem
nec Latina nec Graeca est sed barbara et purgatis auribus respuenda‚' says
Lamb. warmly. But probably it has no connection with λογος, and
belongs to &slah ⁴in ἔλακον loqui locusta: or (according to Curtius) is for
ἐλεγεΐον. 19. videlicet, ironical. 22. ‘ I will not speak further: (Ι
will merely say this z) the very will‚' etc. 23. eius modi est, ut. . . .,

sorum in sense: v. crit. n. Sed tu Acci, cet. This is a good instance
of the dilemma: as such Quint. y. 13. 33, refers to it, ‘ Quid tam videre

quam filium ab Egnatio corrupti iudicii, quo Cluentius Oppianicum cir·
