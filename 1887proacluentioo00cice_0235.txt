XLV. 126] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 171

124—3. quia verum est, v, n. on subscripserint, l. 28, and crit. n.
here. The order of the words is-—quia (id) quod subscriptum est, verum
est. For the omission of the demonstrative, and the double regimen of

‘ clauses, cp. T usc. ii. ἓ 62, apud quos autem venandi . . . laus viget,

(eorum) qui hanc petessunt, (ei) nullum fugiunt dolorem. 5. quod
ln eausa non est: ‘quid enim censoribus curn hoc iudici0?’—MAN.
8. Vince, ‘prove': cp. Hor. Serm. i. 3. 115, nec vincet ratio hoc, ‘ nor
shall philosophy prove this. 11. auctoritatem censoriam, ἓ 117, l. 22 n.
On amplexato, an active form confirmed for this passage by Priscian, v.
crit. n. This ‘ future imperative ' is most common in laws and commands
in the legal style. R. 1495, 1. 613.

125.—12. This calendar of Oppianicus’ crimes is introduced with great
effect : it isa re'sume' of the incidents of the following sections—in the order
of their mention in this passage—41, 41, 37, 37, 23, 25, 26, 34, 40, 30, 31,
31, 31, 27 and 28, 47: the last sentence, cuius ministris, . . . corrumpen-‚
das, ll. 23-25‚ summarises ἓξ 49-69. The fact that Cic. thus brings hisi
heaviest artillery to bear on the ‘ auctoritas censoria,' and that he deals ¹
with it at such length, proves that its moral effect was very considerable at ξ
Rome, whatever its legal consequences may have been. 14. interleverit,
‘altered and interpolated,' cp. n. on ξ 91, (codex) interlitus. Such
an offence might be indicted under the lex Cornelia de falsis, or lex Corn.
testamentaria, a law of Sulla’s, the first of its kind at Rome. Ry. Rom.
A nt. p. 307. 15. supposita persona, ‘ by fraudulent impersonation ' ;
v. Glossary‚ persona. Suppono, ‘ to substitute dishonestly,' αξ. suppositus
puer, ‘a changeling,’ Gk. ὑποβάλλεσθαι, ὑποβολίμαιον τέκνον; here, ‘to
assume falsely.’ 20. uxores, why plural? V. crit. n. Similarly 111 next
line, llberos, cp. ς 31, l. 12. 22. suos liberos, two children, by Novia
and by Papia. 26. inquam, used, as often, in repeating the same word
or phrase for the sake of emphasis, or of resumption at the turning-point
of a long period. Cp. crit. n. on ἓ 65. 28. voluntas, ‘a deliberate
purpose or exercise of will.’ opinio, ‘ a fancy, a belief adopted without
careful consideration ' (Ry. ). Cp. for the former the familiar

510 volo, sic iubeo z sit pro ratione voluntas.

‘ Carpit in voluntas, excusat in opinio. '—MAN.

XLV. 126.—30. Quid igitur . . . statuisse dicent: Cicero is justified
in maintaining that the iudicium notioque censoria (Pis. ἕ 10 t cp. n.
on ξ 117) was not a iudicium in the same sense as a trial before a
quaestio. At the same time certain formalities, approaching in character
to those of such a trial, had to be gone through before the censor affixed his
nota. The person incriminated was summoned, formally accused (cp. si
qui contra dicere vellet, ἓ 134), and allowed the services of an advocate,
before the censors pronounced sentence. Only, compliance with those sor-
malities depended on the censors' will and pleasure z herein lay the distinc-
tion from a iudicium proper. In the present passage Cic. seems to imply that
