Lvrn. 159] CRITICAL NOTES. 263

Nettleship explains it, ‘circuits of the law-court,' ‘assizes as they come
round,' comparing Rep. vi. 12, where it is applied to the circuit of the
sun in the year. The derivation is anfr- (=amb-‚ around) actus, R. 184.

154.—12. insignia. bracketed by Bait„ Kays.‚ as also is exercitus:
partly because the parallel passage Rab. Post. ἓ 16 omits—delectat

’ amplissimus civitatis gradus, sella curulis, fasces, imperia, provinciae,

sacerdotia, triumphi, denique imago ipsa ad posteritatis memoriam
prodita,—but insigma. may well denote the lesser ornaments, whether
of the magistrate (as the ivory staff), or the senator (as the calceus
lunatus). In Sest. ἓ 17, it is associated with fasces similarly—se illis
fascibus ceterisque insignibus summi honoris atque imperii ornatos esse.
V. Rich, Dz'ct. art. Consul.

155.—2o. ea ε’ ex, ST. tenetur, ST 3 teneretur, R; Ry.‚ Mun„ Kl.
Indic. and Subj. are often confounded in MSS. (cp. ἓ 149 n.): but where
grammatical considerations permit, we follow the best MSS. 21. agimUS,
S ; v. prev. n.

LV11.—26. iniquum, so all MSS. save two which give indignum
(Lamb. and Or. ). Cic. retorts upon Accius his own complaint (v, ἓ 150
init.): ‘If there is unfair dealing in the question, it is not the senators
who are the victims, but the people of Rome, who are in danger of being
compromised by the action of a jury which they never sanctioned.'
(Ry. notes this variant in the wrong place, viz, ἓ 154 init.) 28. se
before sine cura. esse, S, Kl. 3 omitted by FM and others, also by Madv.
(Adv. ii. p. 200) ; ipsum, R, other edd. If there is a pronoun here, it
must be ipsum [)(vob1s]: which most MSS. substitute for se of S which
grew out of the last syllable of the preceding word. 30. arbitraretur,
FM ; cp. ἓ 25 crit. n.

156.-—33. causam dicit eques RomanuS, ST; eq. R.. c. d.‚ R; not so
well, for the emphasis on eq. R. is necessary. But ST Wrongly orn.
lege after qua: v. explan. n.

157.—Page 61, 1. 10. hominum, ST, Lamb. ; omnium, R. Cp. §17,
ad hominum pericula defendenda, where inferior MSS. have omnium.
15. infinitum et incertum, all MSS. but ST ; inc. et inf. is preferable for
the sake of the chiasmus with cum infinitum tum obscurum et occultum,
which for the same reason is preferable to cum incertum et infin. tum
obse. et occ„ of Lamb.‚ On, Ry.‚ which has no good MS. authority.

158.—21. sed hoc . . . facessetur, Prisc. viii. 3. 11 ; where most Mss.
give lacessitur, which is clearly wrong. S has facesseret.

LVIII.—32. religionibus . . . vestriS, ST (S has nostris): which
could only be defended as the plur. of a noun of emotion, ‘ conscientious
feclings ’; cp. explan. n. on offlnsz'ones, § 139. But in actual usage it
always means ‘ceremonies of religion,' as in ἓ 43. Cp. religioni. . .
paruerunt ἕ 121.

159.—33. After iudicis, ST have an interpolation, meminisse se
hominem 3 all edd. reject except Klotz who brackets. Pago 62,
