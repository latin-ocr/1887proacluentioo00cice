(ii.) ATTEMPTED P01soN1NG OF OPPIANICUS MINOR.

166.—17. ‘ At his marriage‚' to the daughter of Sassia and A. Aurius
Melinus’ ; v, previous note. ‘Here we have at Larinum, nearly two
thousand years ago, the fashionable wedding ddjeuner of our own times‚’

’ Ry. 18. ld eum daretur in mulso, ‘ when it was offered him in a cup

of mead‚’ or wine mixed with honey. The imperf. of an attempt should
be noticed. mulsum, best taken as a participial form of mulcere,
‘sostened,’ viz., ‘ with honey': cp. promulsis, the antepast of a cena.
'20. que introducing the last term of a series is not uncommon ε Mur. ἓ 1,
mihi fidei magistratuique meo ; leg. agr. ii. ἓ 29, omne vestrum ius potes-
tas libertasque. Et is so used in Cic. only if the appended member have
special significance. Madv. de Fin. iv. 56 (aptae habiles et ad naturam
accommodatae) brackets habiles, and gives many similar instances of
erroneous readings. 22. per quae ε the relative is adversative (cp. ἓ 126),
‘whereas I am now dismissing them with a passing notice.' For the
construction percurro per v. crit. n,

167.—23. Quid umquam . . . accederet: v. crit. n. for the ingenious
suggestion of Mr. Davies, that these words should be transposed to ἓ 170,
where they would refer to the elder Oppianicus. Taking them as they
stand, the meaning of the clause cum flle verbum . . . potuerit is far from
certain. (1) It should mean ‘ at a time when he could not have opened his
mouth in this very case,' being a minor. But Cluent. might have wished
to guard against future contingencies. (2) ‘ Since he could not (then or
now) utter a sentence in his own cause’: referring to the infantia (in-
ability to speak) of Opp. minor, which Cic. derides in ἓ 65, te appello,
Oppianice, te, T. Acci3 quorum alter eloquentia damnationem illam,
alter tacita pietate deplorat ε (so MAN.). (3) ‘ Because he could not have
the shadow of a case against him‚’ P. suggests, but this is shirking the
expression. The second rendering is quite the most satisfactory. It
enables us to meet Mr. Davies's objection, that it could not be denied, even
rhetorically, that Opp. minor was an object of sear to Cluent., and there—
fore, if possible, to be got rid of. Cic. can fairly say, ‘ Opp. minor is no
speaker, and Cluent. could therefore always afford to despise him person-
ally3 again, if you say that at any rate he can afford an advocate like
Accius, andis formidable in that way, I reply, There is always Sassia to
provide accusers when he is gone.' 27. An ut . . . accederet: ‘ But
perhaps the case against him was to retain undiminished its serious
features, and withal to be reinforced by a new charge?’ Here we have
an adversative asyndeton: cp. ξ 138, populum Romanum sua sponte esse
placatum, hominum seditiosorum vocibus . . . concitari. The whole de-
pends upon the one ut: hence for the sake of concinnity we find ut . . .
nihil instead of ne quidquam in the former of the two contrasted clauses.
(We should have expected sua in place of eius ; but the suppressed clause,
hoc facinus in se admisit, is indistinct in the speaker's mind ; and this is not
