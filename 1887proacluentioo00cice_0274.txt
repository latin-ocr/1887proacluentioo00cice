210 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [LXVI. 186

adverbially, ag. hominem studiis optimis deditum idque a puer0, καὶ
ταῦτα ἐκ παιδός.

LXVI.—15. mam nefariam mulierem ε for the omission of tam after
the pronoun, cp. n. on ista multa iudicia, ἓ 88. 17. Atque . . . nomin-
atim: v. crit. n. 19. quem ego proferri malm: ut ei credendum non
esse multis argumentis ostendam—MAN. Cp. n. on ξ 182, ne colonum
dicatis.

186.—22. adferas: ‘inest admiratio quaedam in coniunctivo,' Class.
‘ Are you to come before this court with a capital charge, with a criminal
information‚ with the fortunes of another man indited in a document,
without your naming any one responsible for this document, any 'one who
sealed it up or witnessed it?' AaJeras nec . . . nominabis, paratactic for
the hypotactic ita adferas ut neminem nomines. 23. ‘And do you
expect this honourable court to sanction the instrument, which you have
produced from a mother’s bosom, to deal a most guiltless son his death-
blow? ’ Enough, the depositions have no weight.' Esto is not concessive
here, as usual x it dismisses the subject. 29. hominibus: the abl. with

facere, ‘to do something with a person,’ is instrumental: cp. Sest. §29, ’

quid hoc homine facias : and for a similar abl. the Plautine si quid me fuat
(Poen. 1082), ‘if anything befalls me.’ But the dat. (commodi) is also
used with facere: Hor. Serm. i. 1. 63, quid facias illi? lit. ‘what can you
do for him?’ z'.e. how meet his case? (So ἓ 53, insidias quae fierent
Habito.) This would be the normal construction : the former is the more
forcible, which by a figure the opposite of personifieation (‘ impersonifica-
tion,' to coin a word) treats a person as a thing. R. 1224, r. 499.
187.—Pa,ge 721. 1. Nam gives the reason, not for the previous

question, but for the fact of his putting the previous question. ‘ I ask ⁴

about Nicostratus: jor you know what has happened to Strato.' Cp.
ξ 85 n.‚ and ξ 70, quid tandem . . . nihil enim est quod non fieri possit

. si quis eum forte casus ex periculo eripuerit, nonne reddundum est?
In such cases, while it may be convenient to insert words in translating‚
there is no real ellipse. ln crucem aetum, ‘crucified 't in crucem
tollere is the commoner phrase. 5. sic takes up quasi: ‘just as
if.’ 6. servuli :- the diminutive is here depreciatory, ‘a miserable
slave.'

188.—-7. Cp. Rosc. Am. ἓ 63, portentum atque monstrum certissimum
est, esse aliquem humana specie et figura, qui tantum immanitate bestias
vicerit. Here, however, portentum and monstrum are personal: ‘ Great
heavens! what a monster have we here Ξ In all the world is there any-
where the like of this unnatural phenomenon, of this hateful and portent-
ous abomination to be found ? And, if so, whence has it sprung into being ? ’
For scelus=sceleratus‚ cp. in Pis. ἓ 56, o scelus, o pestis, o labes! cum
exstinguebas senatum, cet. In ἓ 15 it has its ordinary sensez 0 mulieris
scelus incredibile. For immane cp. §41, ut aliquam immanem ac per-
niciosam bestiam : ‘ monstrous ' and even ‘ bestial.’ It is derived from an
