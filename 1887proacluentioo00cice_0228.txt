important passage as to Septimius: quid sit quod P. Septimio senatore
damnato, Q. Hortensio praetore de pecuniis repetundis lis aestimata sit
eo nomine, quod ille ob rem iudicandam pecuniam accepisset: ‘[The
Roman people shall hear from me] why it is that when P. Septimius, a
senator, was found guilty in the court in which Q. Hortensius as praetor
tried cases of extortion, the damages were assessed on this count, that he
had taken a bribe as a juror.' Verr. ii. 1. 95, hoc scitote cum iste civita-
tibus frumentum coria . . . imperaret neque ea sumeret proque his rebus
pecuniam exigeret, lzz‘s nominibus solis Cn. Dolabellae HS ad triciens
litem esse aestimatam: ‘ Understand that, whereas Verres levied corn,
hides, etc.‚ from the states, and in lieu of these, which he would not take,
required payment in money, on these counts alone damages to the amount
of 3,000,000 sesterces were assessed against Cn. Dolabella.' He goes on
to quote the heading of the l. aest. ‘ DE LITIBUS AESTIMATIS CN. DOLA-
BELLAE PR. PECUNIAE REDACTAE‚’ followed by one of the itemS. Verr.

home with him, ·not a sum of money in the shape of damages got from you,
but some comfort sor his dead son in the fact of your conviction and ruin.’

Verr. i. ἓ 39 continued ε hi [qui ambo peculatus damnati sunt] peculatus

‘ These men, both convicted of embezzlement, which was the charge pre·
ferred against thern, had to restore also the bribes which they had received
as jurors.’ Cp. Verr. i. ἓ 38. (iii.) Ad Fam. viii. 8. 2 (Watson, 34):

‘ M. Servilius had been guilty of fraudulent bankruptcy on a large scale,
and the praetor Laterensis, in spite of the representations of Pausanias,
while I was counsel for the defence, refused to entertain an inquiry as to
“ where the money involved had gone ’' ; upon which Q. Pilius sued him
