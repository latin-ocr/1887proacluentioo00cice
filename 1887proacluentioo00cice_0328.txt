264 CRITICAL NOTES. [LVIII. 160

l. 5. cogat, om. ST. Pluygers conj. iudicare for cogitare. 9. reputare
solum esse, ST ; putare esse solum, R.

16o.—20. rei ST: rei publicae, FM, and most inferior codd. ‘Pro
rei dignitate quae ad multas causas pertinet' Class.

LIX.—28. potuerint, ST: potuerunt, R. Cp. ξ 155 11.

161.——30. Decidio, STF z DecItio M. Two inscriptions (C. I. L. v. 1
1187, 1188) support the reading of STF. 31. dixit, ST: uixisti ·· '²
almost all other MSS. , so Class., Kays., Kl. ε dixistis, Man, so two in· ⁹¹
ferior codd. Mull. reads dixistis, which is right. Cic. 'is addressing not
Accius alone, but the whole body of accusers (z'llz‘, ἓ 160). Cp. ἓ 168
dixistis: ἓ 169 dicitis, so ἓ 183. In ἓ 186 he turns to Accius alone.
Pago 63, l. 2. villicos, Lamb., Or„ Ry.‚ after a MS. of Sylvius. Un-
necessary: one of the vilici evidently took the lead. 3, callibus conj.
Ern. for collibus of MSS. which Ry. and Class. retain. Cp. Sest. ἓ 12,
Italiae calles et pastorum stabula.

162.—11. Horo, ST, cod. Sylvii: florio, R. 12. debere, ST:
deberi, R. cp. ἓ 140, posset negare dixisse. 15. cei, ST : Gn„ R. ι celii,
Lamb. 3 caeni, Or.; below, ST have Ceio, M has celo. Inscrr. support
the form ceiuS.

163.-21. serviS, ST: servo, R. In the same line isto in Ry. is a
misprint. 22. vobis: so almost every good MS. A few have nobis,
which Madv. (Adv. ii. 201) adopts, and so Mun. Madv. argues that the
letter v contains several absurdities: ag. iudices, even if their verdict be
favourable, are not patroni. Fortasse he explains, ‘if we are asked by
Cluent.': the weakness of this is evident3 it should mean ‘with us,
perhaps, as his (Ennz'us' not Cluentius’) advocates.' The former argument

· is beside the mark. Vobis is addressed not to the iudices at all, but to,

Accius and his supporters: cp. ἓ 161, dixistis crit. 11. . . . There is
pungency, too, in this reading—‘Accium furis cuiusque causam suscep-
turum esse dicit,' Class. 24. hospitem, ST, Cod. S. Vict. z hospitum,
R. The gen. of quality is, in the case of a concrete word, unknown to
good Latin, except in the case of a concrete word which denotes some-
thing essential and inalienable, and takes the place of an abstract subst.
We might cp. homo trium litterarum; ad sam. ix. 26, non multi
cibi hospitem ; Sall. Jug. 85, hominem veteris prosapiae ac multarum
imaginum ; Rosc. Am. ἓ 17, plurimarum palmarum vetus gladiator; ch.
Agr. ii. 36, via multarum deliciarum et magnae pecuniae. These genitives
respectively express the qualities of thievishness, large appetite, nobility, ¹
distinction in the ring, wealthy display. So too the gen. multorum

hospitum is equivalent to ‘great hospitality,’ and is so far superior im ’.Ε

force to the reading of ST, that I have ventured to retain it. Some
pedant who disliked its colloquial vigour early corrected it to multorum
hospitem. Ambivium, T: A. Bivium, SM.

164.—30. causam ST b (corr. ), vitam R, Class., not so good 3 I have
left it in the text by an oversight.
