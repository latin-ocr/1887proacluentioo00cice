XLVIII. 134] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 177

ἓ 35, torquem detraxit hosti. Et quidem se texit ne interiret. At mag-
num periculum adiit. In oculis quidem exercitus. Cp. n. on quidem ad-
versative in last section. An anti-climax: ‘ not for any depravity,
not even sor any false step—I will not say faulty tendency—in his whole
life.' 31. sanctior . . . probior . . . diligentior: cp. ξ 91, Verres,
homo sanctus et diligens. Pago 51, 1. 2. pudore: ‘honourable
feeling,’ cp. ἓ 12, n. integritas, ‘honesty': cp. Glossary‚ integer.
4. posse z V. crit. n. 5. factum, ‘incident,’ ‘instance ' ε so Verg. A.
ix. 79, prisca fides facto.

134.—-7. P. Scipio Africanus minor was censor with L. Mummius in
B.c. 142. Quint. v, 11. 13, quotes this passage as an instance of ‘proof
by a contrary example.' Valerius Maximus tells the same story (iv. 1. 10),
qui censor . . . vcenturias recognoscens equitum, postquam C. Licinium
Sacerdotem citatum processisse animadvertit, dixit se scire illum verbis
conceptis peierasse. Proinde si quis eum accusare vellet, usurum testi-
monio suo. Sed nullo ad id negotium accedente, ‘ transduc equum,’ inquit,
‘Sacerdos, et lucrifac censoriam notam [‘think yourself lucky to have
escaped the stigma ³] ne ego in tua persona et accusatoris et testis et iudicis
partes egisse videar 'z it will be instructive to compare the italicised ex-
pressions with the corresponding ones in the text. Notice also how distinct
in the censor's mind the preliminary investigation and the consequent
sentence (notatio) are from one another ε cp. n. on ἓ 126. 8. in
equitum censu : this was also called equitum recensus, or eq. recognitio ι
ἱππέων ἐξέτασις, Plut. It must be distinguished from the census populi, as
being, formally at any rate, a military inspection of a standing sorce, and
notos a mere militia. The knights of the eighteen¹ centuries all passed
under review in single file, as their names were called by the crier (cz‘latz‘).
Each presents himself personally before the censors, leading his horse by
the halter ; and according as they are satisfied or dissatisfied as to his
ability for active service, the condition of his horse,l and the number of his
campaigns, he is bidden to pass on with his horse or to sell it ε or he may
be punished by a loss of allowances in case of a slight offence. Unlike the ”
census populi, which was held (as a contio) in the Campus Martius, the
census equiturn took place in the Forum. V. Momms. R. St. ii. 1. 348,
382, 383 ; Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 73. clara ε denoting something
clearly audible, as in ἓ 23, and Lucr. ν. 946, decursus aquai Ι claru' citat
late sitientia saecla ferarum: V. Munro, who quotes Verg. A. vii. 141, ter
caelo clarus ab alto Ι intonuit. 9. contio ε v. Glossary. In this case it
is summoned by the censor as a magistrate : any citizen whatever may be
present : those must be present who have to answer to their names. Cp.
Varro, vi. 87, tum conventionem habeto qui lustrum conditurus est. The
censor, as possessing potestas only, but not imperium, could not convoke
the comitia. possit, on the tense v. crit. n. verbis conceptis,
‘ in set form‚’ i. e. ‘ deliberately ' ε concipere formulam is ‘to repeat a form
