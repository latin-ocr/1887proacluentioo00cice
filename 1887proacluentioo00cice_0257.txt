Lvn. 157] EXPLANATORY NOTEs. 193

been more natural. The general sense of the passage is: they did not
protest against indictment under the lex Sempronia: naturally enough,
for it did not concern them. All they wanted was that this law should
be left as it was, and not altered to their disadvantage. V. n. on ἓ 151 for

⁷ this lex Sempronia. ·

155—21. condicio: v. Gloss.

LV11.—23. quidem, adversative: cp. ἓ 54, re quidem vera, with
note. It opposes interea, ‘meanwhile,’ i.e. the time until the law is
reformed, to the time of ut haec . . . perferatur, the time of its speedy
reform. 26. iniquum, ‘unfair’ ε V. crit. n. aliud agere, ‘ to be
otherwise occupied ' or ‘ interested elsewhere ’ : the opposite of hoc agere,
‘to attend‚' a common phrase in colloquial Latin. Hoc age (=a1iud ne
egeris) was the formula with which the priest at a sacrifice commanded the
attention of the worshipper. Alias res agere (Rosc. Am. 560), or aliud
agere, was the opposite, Cp. Plaut. Pseud. 151, hoc sis vide, ut alias
res agunt. Hoc agite, hoc animum advortite. Below, ξ 179, we have
Oppianicum aliud agentem ac nihil eiusmodi cogitantem. 27. com-
misisse: sine cura esse: parataxis for cum commiserit sine cura esse:
the change of tense by itself indicates this. ‘ Having left the state . . .
in your keeping are undisturbed.’ We may cp. the tenses in Vergil’s
description os the Wolf of the Capitol: (fecerat) procubuisse lupam:
geminos huic ubera circum Ι ludere pendentes pueros. 29. solutum:
adjectival, as placatum, ἓ 138, offensus, ξ 158.

156.—32. silentio, an abl. of manner without an epithet, or an abl. of
attendant circumstances without cum. Instances of such ablatives are
not altogether uncommon even in classical Lat. ε gratiis, sortito, ordine,
dolo, via (‘methodically,' Cic„ 50 via et ratione). Sz'lentz‘o is frequent in
Caes. and Liv. So Sall. Cat. i., ne vitam silentio transeamus veluti pecora.
But sometimes cum silentio, magno silentio. R. 1236, 1241, r. 503. 2.
Pago 61, 1. 1. ea lege, qua lege: on the repetition of the antecedent
v. ἓ 49 n. ei, qui mag1stratum habuerunt, explained by the words of
the law quoted in ξ 148, QUI TRIBUNUS . . . PLEBIS: deinceps omnes
magistratus. Only those public officers who are elected by the people are
magistratus: cp. n. on military tribunes, ἓ 148. All officers are not
magistrates; all magistrates are not senators. 2. ‘1 have not his per-
mission to enter my protest, and plant my defensive works on the vantage-
ground of the law.’

157.-—-10. poena sit, lit. ‘is expended’ : V. Gloss. 11. ‘ In defend-
ing men who are in danger.' Cp. n. on ἕ 17. infinita: cp. ἓ 148, in
quem quaerere? infinitum est. ‘ Unlimited in jurisdiction,' P. 15. in-
certum, ‘vague ’2 obscurum et occultum imply studied vagueness,
‘mysterious and unintelligible.' Cp. ἓ 1, obscurare dicendo. 19. die-
turum is placed thus early in the sentence because it takes up testi-
monium dixit of the last sentence ; neminem coming at the end, with esse
marking its regimen, emphasises the negation.
