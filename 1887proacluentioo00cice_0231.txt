each step before you take it,’ so ‘ slowly,’ ‘ cautiously,' βάδην. 8. ‘ My
loyalty in the defenee of my client': lzuius is governed by de ensionis.
Cp.§ 10, fide atque officio defensionis. 9. dignitas, ‘nor to have
infringed the prerogativae of any person.' V. Glossary.

119.—10. video : v. Glossary. In this sentence the exact distinction
between the terms animadversio and subscriptio clearly appears. 12. illud
commune, ‘the general proposition.' ἓ 13, illo communi dolore muliebri,
‘the anguish which any woman would feel’ )( the private and particular
anguish of this or that woman. 14. 111, § 51, l. 27 11. 15. Of C.
Geta we have the following notice in Valerius Maximus, quoted by Ry. ε
C. Geta cum a L. Metello et Cn. Domitio censoribus senatu motus esset,
postea censor factus est. Metellus and Domitius were censors B.C. 115,
and removed from the senate; C. Licinius Geta, consul B.C. 116, and
afterwards censor B.C. 108. ‘There are plenty of examples, not only of
persons thus notati attaining office afterwards (as Mamercus Aemilius, Liv.
iv. 31. 5, and C. Geta), but of their attaining it while the nota was still
operative,’ that is, before the lustrum inaugurated by the same censors ex-
pired. By gaining office the notatus regained his place in the senate.
Cic. de Rep. 4. 6, censoris iudicium nz'lzz'lfere damnato nisi ruborem adfert.
Itaque ut omnis ea iudicatio versatur tantummodo in nomine, animadversio
illa ignominia dicta est : an important reference, as showing that, at any
rate sor Cicero's time, the substantial penalties wh‘ch the censor could
inflict were (if any) very small. V. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 1693 Momms.
R. Staatsr. i. p. 462 n., ii. pp. 392, 393, 404. 18. reprehensi: cp.
n. on reprehendissent, ἓ 98. 19. moribus praefuisse3 on this
discretionary power of the censors‚ which, whether part of their original
prerogative or not, was the most characteristic and historically the most
important of their duties‚ v, Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 168. Cp. Cic. de leg. iii.
57, censores, . . . mores populi reguum, probrum in senatu ne relinquunto ;
Pis. ς 10, quarn potestatem (censoriam) minuere, quominus de moribus
nostris quinto quoque anno iudicaretur, nemo . . . conatus est ; Liv. iv.
8. 2 (censura) tanto incremento aucta est, ut morum disciplinaeque Romanae
penes eam regimen, in senatu equitumque centuriis decoris dedecorisque
discrimen sub dicione eius magistratus essent. Cp. also infra, ξ 129
praefectus moribus. 20. turpi iudicio . . . ignominia: infamia was
the result of a turpe iudicium, ignominia of the subscriptio of the censor
The former was the more serious and permanent. Conviction in a turpe
iudicium (such as furtum, v, infra 3 iniuria, assault or libel 3 dolus malus,
fraud) was one of the things which disqualified a man sor ever standing sor
public office. But condemnation in an ordinary criminal process was not
enough to do this, nor was the imminence of a serious charge, unless
the presiding magistrate ruled it so (as in the canvass of Catilina,
B.C. 66). As to the censorial nota, probably it did suffice to disqualisy, as
long as it was taken seriously: but sor this period Cicero’s argument
in these chapters (xlii. xliii.) shows that this was no longer the case.
