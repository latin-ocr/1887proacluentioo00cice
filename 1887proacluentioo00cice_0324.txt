260 CRITICAL NOTES. [LII. 144 ἲ

2
other Mss. the reading hac for ao, which necessitates it. Cic. has not ’ἰ
yet mentioned any law which could be referred to by hac loge.

144—19. fortassis, ST; so in ξ 2013 fortasse, R, and edd., except

Bait., Kays. The former is the older form (a contraction probably of ·
forte an sz' vis), and occurs but rarely in the classical period. V. L. and
Sh.‚ fortasse, for a list of passages, to which add Sest. ἓ 12, Verr. i. 11.
ἓ 107 (where it has very strong MS. support): de Off ii. ἓ 20, Balb. ἒ 61.
It is an archaism, probably in vernacular use. 20. displicetne mihi,
ST; Halm conj. displicetne tibi. capitis, ST; cod. S. Vict. (?): a
capite, R. 26. eo capite, T; dc eo, R. 30. videbantur, ST;
viderentur, R.

145.—Pag'e 56, 1. 1. From -ne lege cop. to ἓ 147, et praescripto, we
have P once more. 4. esset actum: fuisset. actum, ST. Same variant
in ἓ 81, where ST are right. 5. obtineremus, PST ; obtinerem, R.

L111.—6. commovet, P, · commoveret, R. Class; and Ry., adopt-
ing the latter, begin a new sentence (Ry. a new chapter), with quod si
nihil.. . Class. objects to the ordinary arrangement of the sentences Ξ
(which I have adopted), on the ground that it makes Cic. speak as if he, ⁴
based his whole defence on the lex: in fact, on the ground that commovet 't
states absolutely what commoveret would state conditionally. But
neque evidently introduces the text for a fresh argument—that law exists
not to be discussed, but to be obeyed. Thus the indic. is required, with
a fresh paragraph.

146.—1 1. contineatur, PST ; teneatur, R. 14. Isid. Hispal. Oraga·-

num ii. 29. 13, lex est mens et animus ct consilium et sententia civitatis.
15. ut corpora . . . non potest, Quint. v. 11. 25. 16. sine mente: in
mente, P. 17. et sanguine, P and others; ac s., STFM; Quint.
18. legib. niq. (sic) idcirco omnes servimuS, P 3 from which Bait., Kays.,
Miill. read legibus denique idcirco omnes servimus. I have retained
the reading of R, and the older edd. (including Class. and Ry.) for the
sake of the triple repetition of legum, and the balance of servi sumus
with liberi esse.

147.—27. ante, PST; antea, R. 28. ergo, PST; ergo est, R;
so Ry. 30. 0. orchivn, TM ; Corchivi, P; 0. Orchivi, S; c.
Orchinii, R. Cp. n. on ξ 94. 31. ambitus, ST ; Kays., Klotz, ;
Class.: de ambitu, R, including P, so Ry., Bait., Miill.: the last of
whom says that we never find sceleris causam dicere. Cp. also Sest. § 18, ἓ
ne de ambitu causam diceret. But we often have capitis causam dicere;
and in such expressions the crime and penalty are often confused, c.g.
with damnare (v, explan. n. on ἓ 97). In such a case we may be guided J]
by the principle ‘ potior lectio difficilior.’

148--Page 57, 1. 1. qui, FM, and most others. 3. et per„ ST;
sed. per„ R. ξ 143 n. The anaphora would be strained. Sed (set) and 1
et are easily confused, especially aster final s. ’

LIV.-10. emerit, om. ST. 16. coit, here and below STFM;
