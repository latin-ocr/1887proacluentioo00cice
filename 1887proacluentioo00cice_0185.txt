ΧΧ. 57] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 121

convey this force, though in ἓ 25, atque haec parva sunt, ἓ 28, atque hunc
tantum, § 75, atque illi omnes . . ., it may seem to do so. It merely
introduces something fresh or'unexpected in continuation‚ perhaps with
some emphasis ; like καὶ μήν. So we have atque, ut intellegatis . . .
(ἐξ 11, 20), atque ut hoc ita esse perspicere possitis . . . (ἓ 43), appending
a fresh argument. Taking the classification of ξ 20 n. we might call
it augmentative in the present passage. ‘Now that Opp. stood
morally condemned at the bar of public opinion, though as yet not
formally condemned by the verdict of a court.' 13. pronuntiatio is
the formal announcement of the verdict (FECISSE VIDERI, if ‘Guilty'—
Vcrr. ii. 5. 14), by the presiding judge. Cp. the case in Verr. ii. 2.
93, iste pronuntiat ‘Sthenium litteras publicas corrupisse videri.’ In
ἓ 73 infra we have ‘placuit repente pronuntiari DIXERUNT': this
pronuntiatio was made by the praeco, who also summoned the parties
(citavit) and dismissed the jury at the end with the word ilicet.—·Momms.
R. Staatsr. i2. p. 349. re, the fact upon which the verdict of society
(existimatio) was based, yiz., the condemnation of his instrument
Scamander: lege the law upon which the verdict of the court (pronun-
tiatio) would be based, vi2.‚ the Iex Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficis.
There is therefore no hendiadys here. 16. ‘Considered the abettors
and accomplices of such crimes worthy of punishment.' The plural of
the abstract noun here is used in keeping with the generic plurals e05,
facinorum. We find plurals of abstract nouns sometimes thus used with
reference to more agents or objects tlcan one. Thus Nat. Deor. 2. 6,
deorum cultus religionumque sanctitates; ξ 101, volatus alitum. The
sanctity, flight, and here complicity, are divided: they appear in a

plurality of instances. Cp. n. on offensiones, ἓ 139. On conscientia, ,

conscius, ν. Glossary. 20. uti ei locus primus constitueretur im-
petr-avit, sc. a iudicibus (cp. ἓ 59, and also ἓ 94, where v. n.). ‘ obtained
his request that the case of Opp. should be placed first on the list for
trial.' The iudices could take the cases before them in what order they
thought best. 23. laudatoribus, witnesses to character (§§ 110, 196,
197). They might come forward as private persons, or as delegates of a
town: ag. the decuriones of Larinum sent a deputation of this
kind to testify to Cluentius' character. Ten was the minimum: in
iudiciis qui x laudatores dare non potest, honestius est ei nullum dare
quam illum quasi legitimum numerum consuetudinis non explere, Verr. ii.
5. 57. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 297.

57.—24. Rem integram, v. Glossary. quamvis suspiciosam, ‘how-
ever unsatisfactory.’ Proper-ly ‘to whatever extent you please': so in
a finite sentence quamvis may qualify the adj. only, sometimes itself
being inflected, as quam volent . . . faceti. . . sint, alia fori vis est, alia
triclinii, Cael. ἓ 67—the subj. being concessive in its own right—‘they
may be as witty as they like, yet the power shown in the forum and that
shown at the dinner-table are very different things.' R. 1627 end, 2281,
