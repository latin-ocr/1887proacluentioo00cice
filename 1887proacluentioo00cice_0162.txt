98 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [VH. 21

the penalty under the lex Fabia varied according to the circumstances of
the offender and his victim. We have another instance of ‘plagium’
in ἓ 162. Cp. Zumpt, ii. 2. 36: ΜΓ. Heitland, pro Rabir. appendix d.
9. inter Sicanos damnari: similar expressions are quaestio (ἓ 147),
iudicium, iuter sicarios ε inter sicarios deferre, accusare, defendere. There
was no substantive to denote the crime which came under Sulla’s law ‘ de
sicariis’: and this clumsy expression supplied the deficiency. Cp. Rosc. Am.
ἓ 90, qui inter sicarios et de veneficiis accusabant. Inter sicarios deferre
is commonly explained as an abbreviation of ita deferre ut nomen alicuius
inter sicarios referatur—‘ to accuse a man as being among the number of
assassins ’ ε quaestio i. s. would be ‘ a judicial inquiry as to those who are
thus numbered.’ But the expressions inter lignarios (Liv. xxxv. 41),
inter falcarios (Catil. i. ἓ 8), meaning respectively ‘in Joiner Street,’
‘in or to Scythemaker Street' (as we might say), seem to suggest
that inter sicarios is a quasi-local designation, applied attributively to
quaestio first, ‘ the Assassination-Court ' 3 then used with verbs, ‘to accuse
or defend in the Assassination-Court,’ quaestione being understood.
sicarius is simply ‘murderer,' the later homicida ; it is by no means
limited to the sense of ‘ professional assassin,’ or that of ‘one who uses
the sica or short dagger,’ the stiletto of that day (although the word used
is characteristic of the times in which this Statute on Murder was
drafted) τ accordingly Quint. defines ‘ sicarii' as ‘ qui caedem telo
quocumque commiserint,’ telum again being defined by the lawyers as
‘quod mittitur manu,’ and in fact denoting every offensive weapon.
Quint. x, 1. 12. 13. illum, deictic: Oppianicus was in court.
14. We may observe that the use of nepos sor ‘nephew' is post-class-

ical. 16. neque obscurus neque incertus: ‘a known man’ (Ry.)-

‘ and one who spoke to the point.' Cp. Hor. C. i. 7. 28, Certus enim
promisit Apollo ; Rosc. Am. ἓ 62, neque testis incertus auditur, ‘ no hals-
and-half evidence is admitted) Certus is used both of things and persons,
‘ unhesitating,' and hence ‘ trustworthy.’ Cp. salsus, similarly applied both
to witnesses and testimony. 17. Ager Gallicus, a strip of land on the
Adriatic coast, between Ariminum and Ancona, in which the Gallie tribe
of the Senones ha'd formerly settled. In ἓ 23, Gallicanum probably (as
P. suggests) denotes an inhabitant of this district. Cp. Cic. Catil. ii. ἓ 5,
prae Gallicanis legionibus et hoc dilectu quem in agro Piceno et Gallico
Q. Metellus habuit, where Gallicanis: ‘ stationed in Cisalpine Gaul,' not
‘ Gallie ’ in general. 22. tamen : ‘the one poor survivor of a numerous
family': ‘ consolandi et quasi deliniendi vis‚' Classen: referring to Div.
in Caec. ἓ 48, ex eo, quod ipse potest in dicendo, aliquantum remittet,
ut tu tamen aliquid esse videare, ‘ something (little though it be).’ Rosc.
Am. ἓξ 8, 104, Quz'nct. ἓ 80, ngrar. ἓ 34. Add Sest. ἓ 63, senatu, quo
si tum veniret, me tamen socium suorum in re publica consiliorum videre
posset, ‘at any rate,’ zze. when everything else failed (Holden). In such
cases a quamquam clause is understood or implied3 as here ex multis
