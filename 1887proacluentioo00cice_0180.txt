116 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XVIII. 50

latio, the accuser’s application for leave to impeach ε nominis delatt‘o .· nomi-
nis receptio, by the praetor who enters the name of the accused upon his
list of cases. (Ry. Rom. Ant. Le.) 24. consulum, ‘ thejury.' Origin-
ally a body of advisers whom the praetor or quaesitor was constitutionally,
though not statutably, bound to summon to assist him in judging. Cp.
n. on 533, 1. 31. The name is retained for the iudices who sat on a
quaestio perpetua. V. Ry. Rom..Ant. pp. 289, 291. For mtegram v.

tus, nemo integer. 25. s1mp1ex causa ad rationem actionis, quae in
iudicio adhibetur, unum crimen ad res spectat, de quibus agitur, ita ut
simplex causa esse possit, etiam ubi plura crimina deferantur . . . contra

forward process, an established fact, a single charge were before the
court.’ 28. mun . . . vicinitatem, n. on §46, l. 14. 32. dignitatu, a&

for this use of the demonstrative with an epexegetic clause cp. de Or. iii.

relative thus used, de Natura Deorum, i. ἕ 38, quoted in n. on ἓ 8.
causam . . . susciperem, cp. n. on ἓ 68, causam . . . recepisset.
Pago 19, 1. 1. causam, in qua. causa.. This repetition of the antecedent
in the relative clause recurs in ἐξ 62, 90, 148, 156, 184. Ellendt (on de Or. i.
,ξ 174) enumerates more than fifty references for this usage in Cic.‚ exclud-
ing cases where res is repeated. As he says, it began in legal and juridical
formulae in which precision is everything : he compares the redundant
language of English Acts of Parliament. It is most frequent with terms
of likely occurrence in law documents, causa, lex, dies, iudicium, locus, >
cet. But it certainly is not confined to legal phraseology. Caesar,
writing, as he does, with military preciseness‚ is partial to it: ag. B. G.
vi. 35, diesque appetebat septimus quem ad diem. Cicero adopts it when-
ever it pleases him to be accurate or formal, even in letters ; ad Fam. vii.

XVIII. 5o.—9. me quidem: some omit quidem here (but cp.
crit. n. ). It is best explained as pointing an antithesis between accusabat
Scamandrum and omnia tela accusationis in Opp. coniciebantur, which
would be clearer if introduced by sed. ‘ When the particle quidem stands
with a concessive signification (indeed, certainly) with a predicate (verb or
adj.), with sed following, it is in the best writers not connected imme-
