170 EXPLANATORY NOTEs. [xm. 123

(together with freedmen and capite censz) the four city tribes.-There
is a corresponding change in the operation of the eensor's nota. In the
earlier period, by placing a man among the aerarii they disfranchised
him. In the later period, the old name is retained, in aerarios referre,
but now it signifies not a loss of tribe, but a change of tribe. The
censor moves a man from a country into a city tribe; one so moved
is called an aerarius still, but he retains the ius suffragii, ius honorum
(cp. n. on ἓ 119, l. 15), and right to serve in the army. Thus it is
that Cicero can say, censoris iudicium nihil sere damnato nisi ruborem
adfert, de Rep. 4. 6. (Momms. R. Staatsr. ii. 390-393, 402-404.)
When Cicero says in aerarios referre aut. tribu movere, he is instancing
two cases of censorial action, which are, for his own time at any rate,
identical. 20. Another phrase equivalent to in aerarios referre is
in tabulas Caeritum refirre; v, Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 82 for the ordinary
explanation of the term. Cp. Hor. Ep. i. 6. 62, Caerite cera digni,
‘men who have lost caste.’ For the act. inf. referre ν. crit. n.
24. inter collegas discrepare: we can say, ‘haec res inter quosdam dis-
crepat,' or ‘de hac re inter quosdam discrepat': although the imper-
sonal use is the more common. This is frequentin Greek ε ag. ἀρκέσω
θνήσκουσ’ ἐγώ, Soph. Ant. 547, for the impemonal, ‘it will suffice that
Ι die.' Cp. also ἓ 104, quae praeiudicia constarent.

XLIV. 123.—28. quia subscripserint : eontrast the mood in p. 47, 1. 3,
quia verum est. The alternative proposed is—Is it true because the
censors have formally alleged it, or did they allege it because it was
true? in fact, ‘is it true on the censor's authority, or is it true in sact?’
In either member the appropriate mood is used: Cic. passes from the* ,2
region of opinion (si statuimus ita esse quia subscripserint, suboblique 4-
subj.) to the region of fact (quod subscriptum est, quia verum est, indic. of
categorical assertion). 30. quid agatis and ne . . . permittatis
both depend directly on videte, ‘take care' : cp. § 97, vide ne mea
coniectura verior sit, with note. V. Glossary, vz‘deo.—‘ Look to what you
are about, or you will find that . . .' (P.). 31. regiam3 regnum in
the mouth of a Roman is equivalent to τυραννίς 111 11131 of a Greek, or
‘ dictatorship,' ‘ absolutism‚' in that osan Englishman. What a Roman
calls ‘royal’ we might call ‘z'mperial.’ 32. censoria, for the adj.‚ as
often in Cic., replacing a gen„ cp. § 68, suppressiones iudiciales,
with note. ma acerbissima proscriptio, n. on. ἓ 88, 1513 multa
iudicia. ‘ Est autem in similitudine nominum quidam lepor ε “ videte,
ne subscriptio proscriptio sit.'''-—MAN. Page 47, l. 1. retundo
has two meanings: (1) to strz'ke back, Catil. iii. ἓ 2, gladios in rem pub-
licam destrictos rettudimus ; (2) to turn the ejdge, blunt, as here : cp. Hor.
C. i. 35. 39, o utinam nova Ι incude diffingas retusum 1111 Massagetas
Arabasque ferrum! 2. illum metator-ium stilum, not gradium,
v. crit. n. The pen of Sulla was as formidable as the dagger which it
resembled. V. Rich, p. 621, for a picture of a stilus.
