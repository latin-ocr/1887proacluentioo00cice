28. potuisse . . . pervenire si . . . voluissent: the oblique statement of :²
one of the ordinary forms of conditional sentence. We have the direct
form in such sentences as Antoni potuit gladios contemnere, sisic Ι omnia
dixisset, IuV. x. 123. 31. splendor: v. Gloss. ‘ Grandeur.’

= ‘ pass by undesignedly‚' will not always hold, at any rate as regards the
latter. 12. sella. curulis, used not only by consuls, praetors, and curule
aediles, but by the dictator, magister equitum, and censor. These held
‘curule office.' The name is derived from currus: cp. equi curules,
