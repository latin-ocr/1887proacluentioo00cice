III. THIRD iudicium: POP1L1US AND GUTTA TRIED FOR Ambitus.

XXXVI. 98.—31. P. Popili: of course a different person from the

Popilius of ἓ 95. 32. V. crit. n. The argument is far from clear: ,

possibly Cic. intended it so. Prof. N ettleship's suggestion (quia acc. for
qui acc„ l. 32) would simplify matters τ the accumulation of relatives here
is unpleasant. Also it seems to gain support from Quint. ν. 10. 108 3 Cicero
pro Cluentio P. Popilium et Ti. Guttam dicit non iudicii corrupti sed ambi-
tus esse damnatos: quid signi? quod accusatores eorum qui erant ipsi
ambitus damnati, e lege sint post hanc victoriam restituti: ‘They were
condemned not for tampering with iudices, but for ambitus, because
their accusers, who had themselves been condemned for ambitus, were
subsequently restored to their civil rights.' This is further explained
by what Modestinus (in ngrest 48. 14. 2) says on the Lex Julia de ambitu
——-‘ qua lege damnatus, si alium convicerit, in integrum restituitur: non
tamen pecuniam recipit.' No such ‘ praemia legis’ were offered under the
lex de sicariis or the lex repetundarum (under which alone the offence of
taking a bribe as a juror could be indicted). Therefore they were indicted
for ambitus, an entirely distinct offence: cp. n. on ἓ 114. (But Cic.
chooses to ignore the fact that at Rome, while a man might be prose-
cuted under one lex, offences contravening another lex might bring about
his condemnation.) V. Prof. Nettleship, Essays in Lat. Lit. pp. 79,
80, 81. 33. ambitus, ‘ corrupt practices ' at an election: an offence
dealt with by a series of laws, the most stringent being the lex Cal-
purnia of B.C. 67, which doomed the convicted briber to perpetual
exclusion from the senate and all public office. Thus when Cic. speaks
here of a restitutio in integrum he refers to the state of the law be-
fore B.C. 67. (Mr. Reid, introd. to pro Sull. pp. 10, 11; Ry. Rom.
Ant. 308, 309.) As to the word ambitus, cp. n. on ambitio, ἓ 76.
Pago 38, 1. 1. in integrum ε v. Gloss. integer. 3. reprehendissent,
‘ had brought others to a reckoning upon the same charge to which they
themselves had succumbed.’ For ffndissent v. Glossary. Reprehendis-
sent, ‘had publicly shown their disapproval,' Prof. Nettleship explains
(Essays, p. 81) ; comparing Font. ἓ 3, atqui homines si qui [tenentur] hoc
genere quaestionis, accusatos et reprehensos videmus primum testibus.
The metaphor is similar to that in ffndoz ‘to pull up‚' ‘ to hold a person
back as he is stumbling or making off ' : Acad. ii. ἓ 139, revocat virtus vel
potius reprehendit manu.
