IX. 28] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 101

indecency in making the proposal, or her heartlessness in the event of her
accepting him.’ The original form of an alternative question was of
this type (frequent in Plaut. and Ten), Utrum strictimne attonsurum
dicam esse an per pectinem‘nescio (Plaut. Capi. ii. 2. 18): lit. ‘ 1 do
not know which of the two [is true], whether (-ne) . . . or (an) . . .
utrum being Neut. Sing of uter. Then the -ne came to be omitted, and
utrum to be considered: ‘ whether.' 4. sed. tamen, δ’ οὖν, resumptive :
‘however.'

27.—7. admiratur : of unpleasant surprise here : a rare use. Cp. Phil.
iii. ἓ 18, admirabilem impudentiam audaciam temeritatem. 8. V. crit. n.
9. reformidat, ‘recoils from the vision of.' 10. respondit: for the
tense v, crit. n. on ἓ 132. 11. domo, ‘ from home,' not=domi, as Class.
and L. and Sh. (sub voc. domus); cp. ἓ 6,iudiciaiam facta domo deferemus:
and Plcz'l. ii. ἓ 26, consilium peterent foris potius quam domo. Translate
‘must look for a remedy at home.' 14. Teanum Apulum, so called
to distinguish it from Teanum Sidicinum in N. Campania, lay s.E.
of Larinum. 17. solebat: for solitus erat, answering to the Historic
present arcessit. 20. ante quam luceret: the use of thev subj.
marks that there was a connection of purpose or intention, not a mere
connection of time, between the two actions of the principal and depen-
dent verbs. So with priusquam and dum, as in the famous ‘ rusticus ex-
spectat dum defluat amnis ’ (Hor. Ep. i. 2. 42). R. 1672, r. 698. ‘ The next
day was not allowed to dawn before he was placed on the funeral pyre.’

28.—-22. quisquam is not irregular here: it is implied that no one of
Oppianicus' household brought the news: in fact the sentence is quasi-
negative. Cp. Sen. Ep. 17. 6, hoc prius quaere quam quicquam.
Catil. i. ἓ 6, quamdiu quisquam erit qui te defendere audeat, vives-
implying a doubt that there will be any one of the kind. Quisquam
means ‘any single one‚' ‘any whatever,’ ‘where all are excluded, or
the barest minimum is sufficient to justify an affirmative' (R. 2278,
r. 898): quivis and quilibet, ‘ any one you will ' where all are included.
The rule that quisquam is only used in negative and quasi-negative
sentences is in the vast majority of cases true: but there are some
exceptions, especially in Livy: eg. xxv. 6. 17, nos, quibus, nisi quod
commisimus ut quisquam ex Cannensi acie miles Romanus superesset, nihil
obici potest: ‘we are to blame that any single soldier survived the field
of Cannae,'—where the implication is positive and not negative. 26. cum

. necatur: on this use of cum with the Indic. following the principal
verb, v, R. 1733, r. 735: cp. ἓ 72, unus et alter dies intercesserat cum
res parum certa videbatur. [N otice the present, equivalent to ‘ when they
proceed to kill the second son.'—H. J. R.] 28. spe optime confirmato:
v. crit. n. I take laetanti animo as the Abl. case, referring to Sassia.
Mr. Peterson takes laetanti and confirmato as Datives in agreement with
Oppianico: on the ground that a ‘better sense is obtained by supposing
that it is Oppianicus who rejoices that he has now secured the woman
