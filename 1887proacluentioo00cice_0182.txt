118 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XIX. 52

defuissem3 the transition from the general to the particular need not be
a difficulty.⁴ We might have expected si etiam in m. f. cet. In Greek
it is the rule rather than the exception. 27. in: cp. notes on ἐξ 13, 32.
28. Itaque, ‘and thus,’ answering to ita constitui, l. 25. ‘ I battled, 1
pressed everything into the struggle, I resorted, so far as in me lay, to
every nostrum and loophole for a desperate case, with this result, though 1
will say it with diffidence, that it was impossible for any to suppose that the
advocate had not done justice to his case.' 30. meam, future indicative,
which is commonly used in such parentheses z ξ 193, paene dicam; de Or.
i. § 98, vere loquar 3 yet Plane. ἓ 24, timide dico, sed tamen dicendum
est. In the latter passage the qualification contained in the words is the
same as it is here: the orator fears that his sels-praises may offend his
hearers. [Mr. Roby takes dicam as pres. subj.‚ under R. 1540, r. 644 b,
or R. 1590, r. 666 a.] So Classen's note is wrong: haec non modestiae
causa Cicero adiecit, sed quod in tam turpi causa vix honestum videbatur
tantum a se esse praestitum. Cp. end of ἓ 109.

52.—32. ut quicquid for ut quicque, an archaic use which may have
held its ground in popular speech. It occurs in Lucr., ag. i. 289, ruit
qua quicquid fluctibus obstat ; again in Cic. ad Fam. vi. 1. 1, quocunque
in loco quisquis est, idem est ei sensus . . . ex interitu rerum et publi-
carum et suarum. Properly quisquis is only an indefinite relative. R.
2283, r. 899. V. crit. n. apprehenderam: the perfect and plu· ¹·
perfect indicative are used in primary and historic time respectively to
denote a ‘case frequently recurring,' with quicunque, cum, ut quisque,
cet. This iterative use of these indicative tenses is universal in Cicero, 'e
Caesar, and Sallust; Livy and later writers have the subjunctive in
pluperfect and sometimes imperfect tenses. Verr. i. ἓ 19, ut quisque me
viderat, narrabat. Contrast Liv. i. 32. 13, id ubi dixisset, hastam in fines
eorum emittebat. The imperfect of repeated action naturally follows this
pluperfect. R. 1716, 1717, r. 720, 721; Bradley’s Arn. ἓ 434„ ‘As
fast as 1 laid hold of any point, the prosecutor wrenched it from my
hands.’ (Observe the art with which Cic. turns an awkward fact against
his own case, viz, his own defence of Scamander, into an additional argu-
ment against Oppianicus.) 33. quaesiveram, iterative again: and
egeram, p. 20, l. 3. But usus essem, l. 7, commoratus essem, l. 10, are
single facts. Pago 20, l. 6. ventura fuisse, v. crit. n. sor the general
sense. This periphrastic infinitive represents venissent in Oratio Recta,
the apodosis to an unfulfilled condition contained in morte Habiti (=si
mortuus esset Habitus). R. 1784 a, r. 765 a. ”

53.—-13. usu venire, ‘occur.' Venio is seldom‚ if ever, used abso-
lutely with a neuter subject in Cicero, except in this phrase: the only
instance in Merguet (if it is an instance) is Marcell. 527, quod [extremum‚
i.e. finis vitae] curn venit, omnis voluptas praeterita pro nihilo est. Usu
cannot be a dative, as Ry. suggests: it is an abl. modi without an ’
