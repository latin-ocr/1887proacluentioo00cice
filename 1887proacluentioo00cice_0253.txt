ιν. 150] EXPLANATORY‘ Noa-Es. 189

14. ‘Quaestor or plebeian tribune.' We have several instances of
disjunctive asyndeton (the omission of the copula ‘or ') in this chapter.
Even in archaic Lat. it is rare, while copulative asyndeton (as in ‘ruta
caesa,' ‘minerals and timber’) is common. Cic. Acad. ii. ξ 92, inter·
” rogati dives pauper, clarus obscurus sit. 15. nominavit, sc. lex, as
adiungit above. The difference of tense is nothing in such a case: the
perf. refers to the time of the writing of the laW, the pres. to that of its
being read. 17. quo z n. on ἓ 9. convenit convenerit quo . . .
condemnaretur: historic sequence of tenses, the standpoint of thought
being changed to the date (in the past) at which the ‘conspiracy’ was
made. Cp. Mur. ἓ 5, quoted in crit. n. on ξ 152, si const. sit . . .
iudicarint. R. 1510, r. 620. 20. mortales=h0mines‚ in its most
comprehensive sense of ‘ human being ' (end of ξ 202). A favourite word
with Sallust, who also uses it thus in the sing.‚ ag. magnum inter mortales
certamen suit, Catil. i. 5 (Mr. Cook's n.). adligat: ν. Gloss.
23. nunc, n. on§ 120.

149.-—27. qui tamen . . . noluit: v. crit. n. 30. quiddam . . .
aliquid ε 1110 latter word implies ‘ a definite part ’ as opposed to ‘nothing’
Cp. its use in ξ 113, aliquid fuisse in Fidiculani causa quod idem non
esset in ceterorum. Otherwise quiddam might have been repeated, cp.
ἓ 157, est quiddam quod ad me pertineat. ‘Cluentius has of course his
share in the case: but I too have mine.' 31. sua interesse: the abl.
sem. is always used with interest and refert in the case of personal pro-
nouns : the original expression was perhaps meae rei fert, then meae refert,
mearefert: interest taking the same construction by analogy. V. R. 1285
(r. 519). Pago 58, l. 3. ‘Can content themselves with my powers
as an advocate.' 6. 1100 1000, ‘at this point‚' ‘in this part of my
speech.' So Sest. ἓ 119, et quaeso hocloco iudices ne me . . . ad in-
solitum dicendi genus labi putatis. Contrast hoc in 1000, ἕ 79, ‘ speaking
where I do.’ 7. a me desiderari, sc. by his hearers. V. crit. n. '

LV. 150.—10. ut . . . confitear, ‘supposing that I were to allow it to
be ever so unjust ’ ε cp. 111 tibi concedam, ἓ 146 init. ; Yusc. i. ἓ 49, 111 0111111

rationem Plato nullam adferret, ipsa auctoritas me frangeret. 11. ‘ Not
that we are to dz'sobey these laws now in existence’: such is the force of
the pres. here, not ‘ we do not obey.’ 13. recusavit ne . . . se putaret

uti oportere ι pleonastic expression for ‘ recusavit 110 1110101111’ : cp. § 143,
opinionem quod existimaris, and note; ἓ 154, 11011 1100 recusabant ne ea
lege accusarentur. Consult crit. n. on the various readings. 15. 0011-
dicionibus: v. Gloss. 17. haec omma . . . commodo compensantur.
The verb compenso (prop. ‘to weigh one thing with or against another ')
may mean ‘to counterbalance' an evil by a good, being construed with
an abt, or to ‘make (a good thing) a set-off against an evil,' being
construed with cum, as in Hor. Serm. i. 3. 70:

amicus dulcis, ut aequum est,
cum mea compenset vitiis bona,
