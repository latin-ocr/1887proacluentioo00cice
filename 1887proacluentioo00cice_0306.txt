of a line. 4. Kayser brackets qul 1111 quaestioni praefuerat ε but the
explanation is quite natural here, as that in ξ 74, 1. 32, is some way back.
Pluygers (perhaps objecting to the construction, for which v, explan. n.)

brackets memini. 7. clamore, ST; clamore hominum, R; the '

hominum is repeated from the preceding line.

80.-11. quod intempore . . . prosit, Quint. ix. 3. 82. Also Curius,
Fortunatianus‚ p. 92, ed. Capp. obsit quin quod, Quint. l. c.
14. For at all good MSS. have ac, which Klotz retains. 15. non before
quod, om. STM.

XXX.—17. agnoscite, FM. 18. audet, ST 3 1d audet, R.

81.—-27. versatam . . . constat, Jul. Rufin, de Εἰς. Sent. ἕ 13.
28. esse, om. ST, ep. ξ 77, 1. 9. an a reo, S; an reo, T.
‹uc1t accusator, ST; accusator dicit, R. 29. Mr. Davies suggests
ne pecunia quidem eripi (Hermam. ii. 400). But v. explan. n.
32. fuisset, ST; esset, R. V. explan. n. 33. ipsam: iam (really a
MS. abbreviation for zpsam), ST b (corr.). Class. argues for iam ε saying
that ipsam would mean ‘the mere multitude,’ etc.‚ as if this were an
insufficient terror. But ipsam means ‘taken by itself,' ‘without any
accessory bribe from the accuser,' answering to ‘ut nz'lzz'l opus esset
pecmzz'a,’ l. 30, in the corresponding clause of the accuser’s speech.

Page 32, 1. 1. criminum et atrocitatem, ST; et atrocitatem
criminum, R. 4. omnes . . . commereatur, S.

82.—-11. ad, ST; nunc ad, R; Garatoni saw that nunc of the
vulgate was altogether pointless. 15. iudicibue, ST, Ry., Class.;

ducibus, R, Bait„ Kays„ Mun. The latter reading, as C1ass. says, ’

is tempting‚ because it preserves the metaphor3 but in what sense can
the jurors be said to track the ‘profectio ' of the bribes? this is surely
the work of the orator: vobis iudicibus, on the other hand, contrasts the
equity and calmness of the present occasion with the ‘invidia iudicii
Iuniani) So ἓ 88, hodierno die primum veritas vocem contra invidiam
‚lcz's iudicibus freta misit. Prof. Nettleship has suggested indicibus
(sourn. Plzz'lol. no. xvi. 1879), comparing Verr. ii. 1. 105, iste
praetor . . . utrum admonitus an . . . qua est ipse sagacitate in his
rebus, sine duce ullo, sine indice, pervenerit ad hanc improbitatem,
nescio. This reading ingeniously reconciles the two variants. It is
exposed to Classen’s objection. But that objection is not fatal. Cic. is
not speaking precisely : the jury, as such, could not be said to have spent

eight years in sifting the charge against Cluentius, nor the counsel (as we ᾗ
should have to understand nos, cp. ἓ 3, l. 22) t0 be now concerned to ·
unearth the offender. Cic. is merely saying in general terms that the ἶ

public (nos) looks to the jurors, as men who are qualified to lead opinion,
to give the only verdict possible.

83.-21. cur, om. F M. 22. qui, Classen’s emendation, which 'i
Bait.‚ Kays, Klotz >have adopted; cui quod, S ; quod, T; cui, R. 7
