xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

It is interesting to find that Vergil honours the gens Cluentia (along
with the gens Sergia) by finding it an ancestor among the Aeneadae— “

Scyllaque Cloanthus
Caerulea, genus unde tibi, Romane Cluenti,—

and also that a Samnite general, L. Cluentius, commanded in the Socia

(α) Dinaea, a rich old lady of Larinum, survived three of her children,
Num. Aurius, Magia, Cn. Magius. Already a heavy blow had fallen on
her,—the disappearance of her son M. Aurius in the Social WVar. News
came to her that he was alive just before her fatal illness: and she left
400‚ooo sesterces by will to him, but the bulk of the property to young
Oppianicus (§§ 21, 22). This illness is attributed, in ἓ 40, to poison ad-
ministered by L. Clodius, a quack doctor introduced to her by OppianicuS.
She died about the time of Sulla's victory, B.C. 82. ,

(β) Taken prisoner in the Social War at Asculum, enslaved, and thus

for years lost to his family. At last news came that he was in the hands

of Q. Sergius, a senator. This was just before his mother's death. F riends
proceeded to the Ager Gallicus to ransom him. Oppianicus used bribery
to delay the accomplishment of their purpose. F inally he had M. Aurius
assassinated, doing all this that the whole property of Dinaea might pass
to his own son, §3 21, 23, 24: ‘ avunculum filii sui,' ἕ 125.

(γ) Died after the disappearance of M. Aurius, for he made his half-
brother Cn. Magius his heir.

(δ) Died third of the family, leaving his property to be divided between
Dinaea and Oppianicus the younger, son of his sister Magia (ἓ 21). But
we read in ἓξ 33, 34, that he left his wife, who was expecting her confine-
ment, a legacy payable through a posthumous son and heir, if such were
born. This precaution against the intrigues of Oppianicus was unavailing,
ἓξ 34, 35. The reversionary heir, Oppianicus minor, got the :whole
property eventually.

(ε) v.VII. ‘wives of Oppianicus? 3.

(ζ) Died second of the family of Dinaea, after Num. Aurius: probably
about B.c. 87 3 v. ⁶ Wives of Opp.'

The expression in ἓ 40, quo curante suos omnes (Dinaea) perdidisset, is s
not to be pressed into a direct charge of poisoning against Oppianicus,
