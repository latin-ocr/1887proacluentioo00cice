IV. 1 1] EXPLANATORY NOTIjJS. 89

Hannibal, se in castra redituros, nisi de redimendis captivis impetravissent,
si non redierunt, vituperandi. V. crit. n., and R. 1532, 1752, 1757, r. 640.
[Mr. Roby does not distinguish nisi and πί so strongly.] 22. incolu-
mis is strictly ‘ one who has not lost civil rights by a legal conviction ' :
such loss being expressed by calamitas (συμφορά in the Greek orators),
with which it is etymologically connected (v. Gloss. calamitas). Cp.
Arclz. ἓ 9, Gabini quam diu incolumis fuit levitas, post damnationem
calamitas. Hor. Serm. i. 4. 98—
ineolumis laetor quod vivit in urbe ;
sed tamen admiror, quo pacto iudicium illud
fugerit.

et pro vivo, v. crit. n. 23. ignominiae, not technically used here.
‘Need any one hesitate to speak . . .‚ speaking as he will be against a
man whose conviction has placed him absolutely beyond the reach of
dishonour . . ., and speaking (as Ι do now) for one on whom a
reverse must entail the k'eenest sufferings of a sensitive mind and the
gravest personal degradation?' 25. offensio, a mz‘sfhrtune (lit. tmpping -
up) in the law court or at the comitia3 metaphor from wrestling or
running contests, cp. n. on§ 10, 1. 25. In de Off i. ξ 71 (ubi v. Holden n.)‚
coupled in the plural with repulsae, and means ‘ a defeat at an election.’
Offendere (ἓ 63 sub fin.) is similarly used; v. Closs. 26. et sine:
ν. n. on ξ 3, subfin.

11.—26. Atque, cp. n. on g 20, l. 32. 28. gloria, ‘desire of

’ glory‚' ‘ vain ambition ' : a familiar example of the subjective uSe of what

is properly an objective word. Cp. the use'z‘ndzgnitas, ‘ unworthiness of
treatment,' to signify ‘indignation,' viz. the sense of such treatment:

- veritas, ‘the love of truth.’ There is more differentiation, a subtler

analysis of terms‚ in modern than in ancient speech.1 Mr. Nettleship-
quotes Rab. Post. ξ 38, quod genus tandem est illud ostentationis ct
gloriae? 30. long-lus exordium petam (ep. ἓ 58, alte petito prooemio),
‘ shall carry you some way back for the commencement of my proof.’ Cp.
Verg. Aen. i. 262-

longius et volvens satorum arcana movebo,

where longius (lit. ‘further ') means ‘going into the future,' as here it
means ‘going into the past.' Here however it is an adjective, not an
adverb: Quint. (iv. Ι. 79), quotes the passage paulo . . . intellegetis to
illustrate his doctrine, ‘ si longior sequitur ac perplexa magis expositio, ad
eam ipsam praeparandus erit iudex! 31. ne patiamini, cp. §6, ne
repugnetis, note. ι ’
V.—Page 5, 1. 1. ‘There was one A. Cluentius Habitus.’ For the
order of the words—the proper name being placed first—cp. the opening
words of other narratz·ones,-c. xv. 343, e. xvi. §46, Rosc. Am. ἓ 15 <a very
similar passage) : Liv. xxi. 8. 10, phalarica erat Saguntinis missile telum ;

Ῑ Cp. Niig. ξ τ7. 1.
