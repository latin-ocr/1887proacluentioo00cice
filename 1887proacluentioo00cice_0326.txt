262 CRITICAL NOTES. [ιν. 152 ἶ

to be a marginal note, quaestio in vet. iud„ altered and foisted into the
text.

152.—Page 59, l. 8. sese, ST; se, R. The emphatic form of the
reflexive pron. here answers to its emphatic position, and the somewhat
unusual construction of volunt: v. explan. n. 11. 111 potestate sua, read
by all MSS. but one, and emended by Man. Cp. ἓ 130, in invidia (most MSS.).
Final -m is in MSS. very evanescent. sl constitutum est . . . iudicarent,
all MSS. ; Lamb. first read si const. sit . . . iudicarint, the last word
after Man. ε Class. and Ry. retain the MS. reading. Classen argues that
the indic. represents their confident hope (‘ the certainty they felt,’ Ry.),
‘ qua tanquam factum sibi proponunt quod sperant.' That is, we have si
const. est sor sl const. sit of strict or. obliqua. But it should be sz‘ const. erit,
the 2d Fut. ι the Perf. Indic. requires that the action be completed at
the moment of speaking. In fact the tense is the difficulty. The required
correction is a very simple one. Sit and est (written st) are often con-
fused in MSS. Cp. 5 148 n. Still less can iudicarent be defended,
explained as ‘ the class of men acting as jurors,’ as opposed to the jurors of
any particular trial. The tense is again the difficulty. Contrast the
Pluperf. iudicassent (ἓ 153), to which a Pers. in primary time (as here)
must correspond. In Mur. ἓ 5, a similar correction is desirable (legem
hanc) ita tuli ut eam quam mihimet ipsi iampridem tulerim . . . non
abrogarim (for -arem of MSS.): there, however, Cic. may look back to
the time of the passing of the law (cp. ἓ 148 -supra, qui . . . convenit
convenerit, quo quis . . . condemnaretur): here, in the nature of things,
the standpoint of thought cannot be changed to the past.

LVI. 153.—21. ageret quam cum ula c. q. t. erant nobilitatae, all
the MSS. : early corrected. GraeV. objects to the concrete meaning of
nobilitas: but V. explan. n. 22. ut 61 qui, a conj. of Halm, so Bait.,
Kays., Mull. : utique, Mss. ; uti qui, Man. conj., Class., Ry.
24. ceterique eiuscemodi ordinis, ST; ceterique huiuscemodi ord„
R. The occurrence of huiuscemodi four times in two sections would by
itself be suspicious: here, where it is meaningless, it must be salse.
Class. suggests equestrisque, in place of ceterique (two MSS. have
ceterisque), and would eject huiuscemodi (eiuscemodi), without com-
pensation ; Bait., 'Kays., accept this emendation, which hardly accounts
for the reading of ST. Kl., Mun„ and Madv. (Adv. ii. p. 200), read
ceterique eiusdem ordinis, which must have repelled previous editors by
its simplicity. 27. recusarent: Madv. Adv. ii. p. 200 conj. reputarent
(so Miill. ). He argues that repugnarent cum recusarent (hoc est repugna-
rent) is tasteless : and that llaec after recus. should be hoc (as referring to
one chapter of the law). But the pleonasm objected to is in Cicero’s style :
and haec reputarent after ut aliquid . . . putarent would be somewhat
misleading. (Man. conj. cum et recusarent.) Page 60, l· 1. After
iudiciorum many edd. give the word anfractu, which apparently would
mean ‘intricacies' here, but which rests on no Ms. authority. Prof.
