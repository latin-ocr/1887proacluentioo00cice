it must be more thorough-going than this. We might consider Staienum
iudicem and cum in consil. mittebant glosses on eum and cum in consil.
iretur, introduced into the text. This would leave us with the following
version of the second half of the sentence: cur qui [qnam ?] pecuniam

z ἡ dederant non requirebant ? In the text the change of mood after cum is

remarkable. 22. requirebantur, FM; quaerebant, S. Cp. ἓ 183, n.

brackets it as a certain interpolation ; Bait. and Ry. bracket ; Kays. ex-
punges, adding est instead ; Miill. reads it, omitting et. Classen's masterly
note, which is too long for transcription here, should be consulted. The
words are objectionable (a) as almost repeating the opening words of the
sentence3 (b) as only varying them for the worse. The hendiadys
conciliationis et gratiae is inopportune: so much so that Manutius
expunged et, and Orelli bracketed it. The phrase dare fabulam should
properly mean ‘ to put a farce upon the stage ' z thus (as Ry. suggests) the
words of ἓ 86, illud quod tum explosum atque eiectum est, would be anti-
cipated. But the sense requires fingere fabulam, ‘to concoct a story.'
· The motive for the interpolation is to be found in the desire to relieve
the phrase admonitus excogitavit, which is quite intelligible—‘worked
out the hint which he got from Cethegus. '

Ry. retain. Class. justifies the latter, as representing Sassia’s enmity as
an obstacle to the reconciliation of Cluent. with Opp.‚ whereas the other
reading puts a reconciliation with Sassia on the same footing as a recon-
ciliation with Opp. But the obstacles to reconciliation clearly begin at
haerebat, and are enumerated in independent clauses. [To the same effect
writes Madv„ Appendix ad Disp. de Ascon. p. 45 3 adding that had Cic.
meant to represent Sassia’s enmity as an insuperable obstacle, he must have
used a stronger word, such as ‘inimicitias gravissimas,' to describe it:
‘simultates enim componi possunt.' The interpolation is due to a mis-
„3 understanding of the repetition of the particle quel] 30. Cluentius:
