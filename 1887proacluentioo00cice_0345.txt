‘the theory of a venal arbitrator . . . would not hold,' ‘was not
satisfactorily upheld' ; ἓ 138 iudiciorum quae probata non essent:
ἓ 158, ξ 181 cui probatis? (b) of persons: ἓ 52 cui probatus esset
ipse patronus, ‘to whom he had approved himself,’ ξ 77 iudicia eius
ordinis populo p. (2) to hold as good, to approve: ξ 16 ea . . .
non solum videre verum etiam probare suo iudicio, ἕ 128 illud
minime probandum quod . . ., ‘to sanction, indorse, approve’
—the meaning ‘assay ’ is not Ciceronian. But in this and meaning
(2) δοκιμάζω coincides with probare. [Probo however often means
‘ to pass work,' τῖε. judge it to be sound ε probatio (columnarum) erat
tua, ‘it was your business to see that they were sound,’ Verr. ii. 1.
142.—H.N.]
⁵ praevaricari [prae ‘past' and varz'cari ‘to walk crookedly‘ (akin to
varus varius)] prop. of a ploughman driving a furrow crooked:
hence metaphorically (1) of an accuser, ‘qui colludit cum reo,’ z'.e.
conducts his case in the interest of the other side, ‘to be guilty of
collusion ἰ so ἓ 87 an [pecuniam dedit] ut praevaricaretur? ‘ was it
to induce Cluentius to betray his case to the defence?' (2) of the
advocate on either side, who conducts his case disingenuously: § 58
ut interdum non defendere sed praevaricari accusationi videretur.
Hence praevaricator: Pis. ξ 23 P. Clodius is called Catilinae p.,
‘sham accuser‚’ having been bought off by him, when he impeached
him for extortion. [V. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 314]
quaestio: (1) ‘act or process of z'nquz'ry’: (a) judicial inquiry‚ ‘trial ’z
ξ 90 illa tandem q. aut disceptatio aut iudicium fuit? ἓξ 96, 137,
159, etc. (b) ‘examinationss especially by torture, ἓξ 177, 181, 182
q. de viri morte habebatur ; (2) concrete, ‘ the results of such examina·
tz‘on,' ἓ 185 hanc fictam q. conscripsisse, and again, q. obsignare;
(3) more concrete, ‘the court of z‘nqnz'ry,’ the persons who inquire:
- ξ 1,§ 147 quid M. Plaetori . . . inter sicarios . . . quid reliquae
quaestiones? ἐξ 148, 151, 155, etc. Especially of the q. perpetuae,
or Standing Commissions to try crimina] cases, the first instituted
being that by L. Calpurnius Piso, B.C. 149, to try cases of repetundae.
Such standing commissions contrast with the special commissions
which preceded them, and which consisted of quaestores to whom
the supreme court, the comitia, delegated its powers in certain cases.

ratio (re-or ; dr} or ›da—r, to joz’n, so put together, reckon) ε (1) reckon-

r. temporis ἓ 141 ‘ the requirements of the time': officiorum et
amicitiarum r. conservata ξ 117; (2) consideration as a special
form of reckoning, r. venefici criminum ξ 1: hence concretely
(a) a problem or particular case, Cluenti ratio cum illis legibus . . .
