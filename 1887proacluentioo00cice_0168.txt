104 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XI. 32

HOMINEM LIBERUM DOLO SCIENS MORTI DUIT, PARICIDAs ESTO (Paul.
Diae. after Fest. p. 221 M.). And accordingly we find Priscian, i. ἕ 33,
apparently preferring to derive the word from parem, caedo: whereas
the ancients generally derived it from patrem, caedo. So too modern
scholars have (a) either connected it with pater, or (b) taking as original
the meaning ‘murder with msslice aforethought’ (dolo sciens), have sug-
gested the root παρά, Skt. para, Lat. perperam. The latter view (at any
rate as regards the meaning) is that of Mommsen, Isz'st. i. p. 158
Eng. tr., Ram. Staatsr. ii.2 p. 528. Rein (Crz'mz‘nalreclzt, p. 450),
objecting to the vowel-change assumed in the derivation from para,
also considers ‘murder of a parent’ to be the original meaning.
The words of Paul. l.c., may well be explained, ‘let every murderer
be regarded in the same light and punished by the same law, as if
he were an actual parricide.’ This would seem to be Ramsay's view3
his interesting note should be consulted. 3. ‘ To pave the way to
this abominable crime, he secured his approaches by other guilty deeds.’
The metaphoris taken from pioneering or road-making: cp. leg. agr. ii.
ἓ 17, viam sibi ad beneficium impetrandum munire ; not dissimilar is the
metaphor in leg. agr. i. ἓ 27, honori velificari suo ‘ to make sail for,' zze.
gain an advantage for. The term munire (‘fortify') of making a road,
well expresses the compact structure of the Roman road, which was
always military in its main purpose, and was built to last: v. Rich,
Antz'quz’tz'es, articles via, agger. 8. poculo mortis: mortis=morti·
ferum. But the Gen. of quality without an epithet is very rare ; and mors
denoting a ‘deadly draught' would be highly poetical. Gruter suspects
the word: V. crit. n. [Ι see no difficulty in referring it to R. 1304

r. 523 12.-H. J. R.] 6. illud, quod . . . conceptum, cp. liberos, -

l. 12. 12. liberos; the Plural is used to describe, with intentional
vagueness, the yet unborn child ι cp. use of the neuter in 1. 6, and p. 13,
l. 2. Cp. Ter. Andr. 891, domus, uxor, liberi inuenti inuito patre. So
too in Sulpicius' consolatory letter to Cicero on the death of his daughter
(ad Fam. iv. 5), cogita ea nobis erepta esse, quae hominibus non minus
quam liberi cara esse debent, patriam, honestatem cet. This use of the
Plural is not so common in prose as in poetry, which constantly prefers
vague suggestion to explicit definition. hano lucem, ‘this light os

Plaut. and Ter., luciscit hoc iam. 15. custodiae: for the number
v. crit. n. 16. Quintil. (viii. 4. 11) quotes this passage to exemplify
‘amplification by a comparison ’3 by which he denotes a kind of a
sbrtiori argument. ‘ In Oppianico non id agitur in illa comparatione, ut
ille male fecerit, sed ut peius’ (ib. 12).

cp. n. on p. 31, 1, 4. 17. Cicero went to Greece and Asia, B.C. 72,
according to Plutarch, from fear of Sulla, whom he may have offended
by his attack on his freedman Chrysogonus in the pro Roscio Amerino:
