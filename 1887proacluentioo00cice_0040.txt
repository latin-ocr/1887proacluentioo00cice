xxxii INTRODUCTION.

ἓ 16. Immediately after her husband’s death Sassia de-
termined to institute an inquiry into its causes. To this end
she purchased Strato, a slave of A. Rupilius, her late husband's
physician, and examined him by torture, together with Ascla,
one of her own slaves, and the faithful Nicostratus, whom she
had forced her stepson Oppianicus the younger to give up to
her. The examination was held in the presence of a council of
respectable men, friends of Oppianicus, but in spite of the
cruel severity employed, her object, which was to get evidence
against her son Cluentius, was not attained. A fresh and
even more cruel inquiry was held 3 nothing was extorted from
the loyal slaves, and Sassia was compelled by the witnesses
to desist from further cruelties. Nicostratus was restored to
his master 3 Strato was taken into favour by his new mistress,
’ and established at Larinum as a medical practitioner. Three
years passed in inaction 5 her malice was only dormant.
Towards the end of that time she married her stepson to her
daughter by A. Aurius Melinus, wishing by this connection,
and the hopes of a succession which it involved, to acquire a

, complete hold upon him. This step was well-timed3 the

services of young Oppianicus were speedily to be called into
requisition Our attention is invited to a story of crime taken
from the annals of slave-life, but not at all more hideous than
the misdeeds of the high—born and the free which occupy the
main part of the speech. Strato stole some money from a
chest‚ murdered two of his fellow—slaves, and threw their
bodies into the fish-pond. By an accidental discovery the
guilt was brought home to the offender3 a boy who was in
the secret told the truth to his mistress. She seized this
excuse to put Strato, and with him Nicostratus, once more
upon the rack. This time no respectable witness was present.
The depositions thus extorted were taken down, and now, at
the trial of Cluentius, Sassia produces them in evidence
against him. But Cicero refuses to recognise them, for they
contain not a word about the theft and murders of Strato,
which were certainly the main subJect of inquiry3 they are

not properly attested 3 and of the deponents, Nicostratus is..

not forthcoming, Strato was forthwith crucified, having had his
tongue cut out.

§17. The narrative closes with a vivid description of the
preparations for the trial ,- there is Sassia, on the one hand,
journeying to the capital from the distant shores of the
Adriatic, with her ample retinue and stores of wealth, yet
