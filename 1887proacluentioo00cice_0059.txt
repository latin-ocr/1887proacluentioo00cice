loth, My own opinion in some speech. Ι merely
quoted common rumour, (ἓ 139) I did not know the
facts. It was an advocate's speech, and no judg-
ment. (ἓ 140) Speeches should not be quoted in
this sense. (ἓ 141) Ι may cite the conduct of L.
Crassus when attacked by M. Brutus. (ἓ 142)
The speech was a good piece of advocacy then.
Now I am better informed.

You were wrong, Accius, in thinking I should only
rely on a technical defence. (ἓ 144) I do not
abandon it, but by Cluentius’ desire, expressed in
consultation, I am to rely on the merits, and a very
good defence they afford. It would have been
enough to have cited the LeX. (ἓ 146) Law is the
state’s life : this court (ἓ 147), and all we who preside
in quaestiones, are bound by the law, and any one
may without shame avail himself of the law's pro-
tection. You, Accius, dare to argue that such a
defence is base. (§§ 148, 149) But Cluentius
clearly is not within the LeX, and is entitled to rely
on it, and though he waives it, Ι must and will
meet your argument. (ἕ 150) Base or not, it is the
law. Rank has its penalties; the highest ordo has
a stricter law. (ξ 151) C. Gracchus first enacted
this laW, not against, but to protect, the people.
Sulla dated not extend it to the knights, though he
hated them, and (ξ 152) few now wish to do so, and
those are men who would make the equites' judgments
no longer independent. How nobly Pusio, Titinius,
and Maecenas in Drusus' time expressed the equites’
position. (ἐξ 156, 157) Cluentius waives his legal
right, but otherwise I should rely on it. I must
stand up for the law. If Accius' appeal to you, to
bring all alike within it, should stand, who of the
meanest would be safe? (ἓ 158) In any other man’s
