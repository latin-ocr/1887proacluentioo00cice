ipso in 1000, 110 sat in the ‘subsellia reorum ' (cp. crit. n. on ξ 65, 1. 16),
the part of the court where the accused and his supporters sat : in hisce
subselliis, Rosc. Am. ἓ 59. It is hard to see how this fact by itself should
have damaged the case ε Opp. as an advocatus could not sit anywhere else.
Perhaps Cicero treats an ordinary and necessary occurrence as an omen of
Oppianicus' fate. hoc 1000, ⁴ ex quibus Cicero Cluentii causam agebat.’
—MAN. 29. coniciebantur, ‘were turned upon.' Verr. ii. 5. 175,
· omnium oculi coniecti sunt hoc ipso tempore in unum quemque nostrum.
Also leg. agr. ii. §25, cum ad omnia vestra pauci homines cupiditatis
oculos adiecissent, ‘ had set longing eyes on.'

XX. ξ 55.—32. ‘When the time came for the consultation of the
jury.' The speeches for the prosecution and for the defence having been
heard, and the evidence given, the jury were called upon by the judge to
give their verdict: he is said mittere iudices in consilium, they ire in
consilium (v. ἓ 83). So ἓ 74, in consilium erant ituri iudices xxxii.;
ξ 75, consurgitur in consilium ; which latter passage seems to imply that
they retired from court to consider their verdict. Cp. the expression
in Verr. i. ξ 39, inventi sunt senatores qui . . . exirent in eum reum
quem incognita causa condemnarent. V. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 298.
33. quaesitor, general term for the presiding judge in a quaestio perpetua
whether he was a praetor or iudex quaestionis (supplementary judge for
criminal trials). Ry. Rom. Ant. pp. 291, 292. V. note on ἓ 89.
lege cornelia. The lex Cassia tabellaria (3.0. 137), introduced
voting by ballot (per tabellas) (vocis suffragium, legg. iii. ἓξ 35, 36): it
would seem to have been superseded for a short period by a law of Sulla

(here referred to) which gave the defendant the right of choosing whether »

the jury should vote openly or secretly. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 298.
Compare ξ 75, consurgitur in consilium, cum sententias Opp., quae tum erat
potestas, palam ferri velle dixisset. tum : by the time of this speech the
law had been repealed. Pago 21, 1. 3. Velle : for omission of subject,
cp. n. on p. 14, 1. 1. 5. prima. actione, cp. ξ 76, primo condemnare, and
ἓ 103. In ordinary cases the verdict might be given in three ways: absolvo
(A on the tabella), Not Guilty ; condemno (C), Guilty; non liquet (N. L.)‚
Ποῖ Proven,—this denoting that the juror could not make up his mind.
In cases of doubt and difficulty the majority might vote N. L.: upon this
the presiding judge said ‘ Amplius,' and fixed a day for a second hearing
(secunda actio), the first hearing (prima actio) having sailed to educe the
truth. The same process was repeated, with fresh pleading and fresh
evidence ε and if the jury were still undecided, a fresh adjournment
(ampliatio) might be made. The process was repeated until a positive
verdict was obtained. Ry. Rom. Ant. pp. 299, 300 should be consulted‚
also his note on this passage. 10. sua sponte z non alieno consilio.—
