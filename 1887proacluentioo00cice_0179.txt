xvn. 49] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 1 15

frux, meaning therefore ‘ for profit,’ ‘ profitable ' z and so ‘ thrifty.² Hor.
Sat. 1. iii. 49, parcius hic vivit z frugi dicatur. Hence ‘ virtuous.' (Proprie
de servo dicitur, qui rem domini diligenter custodiat3 sed ad probitatem
saepe transfertur.—MAN.) To the old Roman thrift was a large part of
virtue. We may cp. the slave Onesimus and S. Paul's words about him, Ep.
ad th'lem. 10, 1 1. Pago 18, l. 2. The absolute use of communicavit
is rare z ‘took B. into his confidence,' ‘ communicated the facts to, shared
them with, B.’ not (as P.) ‘put himself in communication wz'th.’ Cp.
Phil. vi. 523, me, quicum profecto . . . pro summa familiaritate nostra
communicasses. qui qua fide fuerit meminisse vos arbitror. So
Phil. ii. §40, vide quam te amarit is quz' albus aterne fuerit ignoras: on
which there is a note (Mne-mos. JV. S. 7. 116 ff.) ‘ soloeea oratio est et
omnino requiritur quem. ' No doubt the anticipation in the main sentence
of the subject of the dependent clause is the commoner idiom ε but it is not
universal. 25. comprehenderetur res, ‘the suspicion might be
clenched.’ 26. Consult crit. n. sor the other reading of this pas-
sage ; and the reconciliation of the statement here with that in ἓξ 49, 53.
8. dabatur, the action of the imperf. is incomplete: ‘ was being handed
over ' ‘ was on the point of being paid.’ Cp. ἐδίδουν in Greek, V. Goodwin,
Moods and T enses, § 11, n. 2. For the circumstances here related Pros.
Nettleship compares Cael. ἓ 62, q.v.

XVII. 48.—12. apertior, ‘ more evidently guilty ' (Ry.). The epithet
is transferred from the offence to the offender: cp. manzfestus, ‘red-
handed.’ 14. a quoquam, ⁴ by any one (even such an orator as
- myself) ' : he is preparing the jury for his own failure to explain away the
charge, ἓξ 51, 52. There is a very similar allusion to his rival Hortensius
in Verr. i. ξ 10, quod est ingenium tantum, quae tanta facultas dicendi et
copia quae istius vitam . . . iam pridem . . damnatam . . possit de-
fendere? 16. aut . . . aut . . . : two alternatives of equal value and
mutually exclusive. Cp. ἓ 64, aut ab Habito aut ab Oppianico. Contrast
the use in 5 6. R. 2220 (a), r. 873.

49,—20. ita . . . ut· . . .‚ ‘under such circumstances, with this limita-
tion, that . . . ἐ a common idiomatic use: cp. ἓ 3, sz'c audire consuestis
ut . . . quaeratis. ἓ 88, § 112. The ita conditions the application of
the statement. It must be translated in each case according to the context.
Here ‘in appearing at the bar of the court, he took his place there as a
condemned man.’ Cp. Plzz‘l. ii. § 85, ita eras Lupercus ut te consulem esse
meminisse deberes, ‘ you were Lupercus ε but you were bound to remember
that you were consul': v. Mayor's excellent note. R. 1704, r. 714 c.
20. citatum, ‘ summoned ' 3 by the praeco on behalf of the Praetor or Iudex
quaestionis: cp. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 295. Momms. R. Staatsr. i. p. 349,
19-21. ‘ Once and again ' : by the condemnation first of Scamander then
of Fabricius, Cp. Phil. xiv. 22, semel et saepius, ‘not once but several
times) . 22. nomen ‹ierunt-q this, the formal indictment by the accuser,
