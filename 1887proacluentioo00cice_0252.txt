was a very busy court at this corrupt time (v. ξ 89 n.), and we gather
from this Section that it employed, besides its praetor, three iudices
quaestionis, Naso, Plaetorius, Flaminius. V. M. R. Staatsr. ii. 1. 192,

‘infinitum.' 13. trib.. mil. leg. quattuor primis. In republican ⁷

times there was no regular standing army: four legions were annually
levied from the citizen body to form two consular armies, and disbanded
at the end of their campaign, unless further required, as was the case in
the Second'Punic war, in which at one time twenty-three legions were
serving. The legions were numbered: the four regular legions of the
year being ranked first. The army did not, as in imperial times, supply
young men with a profession, but with a stepping-stone to public office.
From the year Β. C. 207, the twenty-four military tribunes required for the
four ‘ first legions ’ ceased to be nominees of the consuls, and were elected
by the comitia tributa from the senatorial or equestrian order. The
tribunes for any other legions were named still by the consuls. The
former tribunes were distinguished from them as tribuni militum a populo.
