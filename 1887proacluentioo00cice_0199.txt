XXVIII. 76] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 135

and viatores, the special function of the latter being to carry messages
and summons. The tribunes of the plebs had only viatores. By them
they might exercise their ius prehensz'onis (Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 143). Cp.
Mommsen, R. Staatsr. i. ², p. 262.-The proceedings of L. Quinctius
illustrate the position of the tribunes at this time. He has no right of
‘intercession ’ as against a criminal court (quaestio) or its president
(quaesitor). So Vatin. ἕ 33, quaero fecerisne quod in hac re publica . . .
in omni memoria est omnino inauditum? appellarisne tribunos plebis ne
causam diceres? (this was after being cited by the praetor.) Quinctius
could delay this trial without resorting to intercession. The law under
which the quaestio was constituted generally forbade intercessio expressly.
Turning to l. 2, p. 29, pro potestate dimitti iussit, we have here an in-
stance of tribunician ‘ prohibition, ²—a less formidable weapon than inter-
cession, for it did not annul the act in question, but merely threatened
the agent with coercitio (in its various forms, arrest, fining, execution,
etc.) in case of disobedience. While Sulla limited still more the use
of ‘intercession' by the tribunes, he lest them the right of ‘prohibi-
tion' in full. Mommsen, R. Staatsr. i. p. 2623 ii. pp. 286, 297.
Pago 29, l. 1. publico iudicio . . . privatum iudicium: the distinction
answers roughly to that between crz'mz'nal and civil cases with us ; in the
latter an individual citizen, in the former the state, is held to have been
aggrieved. Ry. Rom. Ant. 275.

75.—3. Cp. notes on§ 55, ll. 32, 33. 6. nummarii, ‘pensioners,' so
ἓ 101, nummarius interpres. 7. 111 Campo, sc. Martio, where the
comitiawere held. Often so designated ε Hor. C. iii. 1. 11, descendat in
Campum petitor, i. 8. 3, cur apricum oderit Campum.

XXVIII.——14. Eece, tibi, ‘lo and behold,' a dat. of the person in-
terested in the statement, 'R. 1150, r. 4783 only used in the case of
personal pronouns. Cornif. iv. ἓ 14 is a good example: deinde, ubi
visum est ut in alveum descenderet, ecce tibi iste de transvorso ‘heus '
inquit ‘adulescens‚ pueri tui modo me pulsarunt; satisfacias oportet!
In the present passage it gives an ironical tone ; sometimes merely
invites attention. So in English: eg. Shakespeare, 2 Hen. I V. iii. 2.
304: ‘ There was a little quiver fellow, and a’ would manage you his
piece thus, and come you in and come you in.' 17. Atque, n. on § 56.

76.—18. inlectus est hominibus scrupulus: so Caec. ἓ 4, sperarunt

. se iniecturos vobis causam deliberandi, ‘would set your minds
working.’ ex vetere ma disemum, probably referring not only
to their old-fashioned integrity, but also to the old-fashioned verdict
which they gave (NON LIQVET), which in Cicero’s time was falling into
desuetude (v, Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 299, ampliatio). [⁶ Men of the old
school of trials.'—H. J. R.]. The phrase recurs in§ 107 with the same
reference—Cicero sometimes uses a prepositional phrase in loose con-
nection with a subst. attributz‘vely (thus here ex disciplina is coupled
with sapientes as an epithet of homines). So Sest. ἓ 64, iniuriis in socios ;
