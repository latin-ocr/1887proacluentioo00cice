genen, ST (so S in 1. 11). 21. se cum Cleophanto, ST. collocutum,
S; locutum, R; cp. ἓ47.

54—24. tota aec„ ST; et tota, R. The antithesis is between verbo
on the one side, re vera et periculo on the other; tota accusatione applies

to both members. 31. et, ST; ac, R.

XX. 55.—32. consilium illum viri, S3 oportet, T ; Q. Iunius, ST.
Pago 21, l. 8. Mommsen brackets id, comparing ξ 62. But ἓ 105
supports the MSS. 9. Quae horum porro, ST.

56.-23. ipse eis: iis alone, T 3 ipsis iis, Weiske.

57.—27. Lamb.‚ Or., Class., Ry. write cepasios.

XXI.—-31. Iam ε Madv. conj. nam (and so Pluygers) on same ground as
in the similar passage§ 46, l. 19, where V. n. hoc prope, STFM z hoc
quoque prope, one Lagomars. cod., which Or. and Ry. retain, bracket-
ing quoque. ‘ It is quite out of place here. Nothing had been previously
mentioned in which the arrangements of Nature could be arraigned as un-
sair,' Ry. Pago 22, l. 2. nisi forte . . . debent, ST b (corn), also
margin of cod. S. Vict., Lamb., Class., Bait., Kays., Kl.‚ Miill.; om. F M,
Graevius, Or., Ry. The words, far from being a frigid interpolation, are
indispensable‚ as rounding off the previous sentence. Cicero has started an
ironical cavil at the dispensations of Nature z ‘ It is very hard that, whereas
in bodily diseases the more serious the complaint the more competent is the
physician called in, in trials, where a man’s civil existence is in jeopardy,
the more serious the indictment the more incompetent is the advocate
retained.' So far there is nothing to show that Cicero is not in earnest ;
but the opening words of the following clause (1πί,τὶ forte), with their ten-
tative solntion of the difficulty (which involves its real explanation), make
it impossible to mistake the banter of the passage, which is aimed of
course at the unfortunate Caepasius—‘but perhaps the reason is that
doctors have only to supply skill, advocates both skill and moral support
(and the latter only a low-class advocate will give to a shady case).'
[Nam quod ea causa, quae unice vera est, et magnum discrimen, quod in—
ter medicos et patronos intercedit, cum specie dubitationis profertur (m‘sz'
forte), hoc egregie fictae praecedentium gravitati convenit. Similem
sententiarum nexum habet, pro Caec. c. i. 2 ; mz'lzz' quidem quum audax
praecz'fflae fuisse videtur Aebutius, tum impudens in iudicio . . . .· nisi
forte hoc rationis habuit, quoniam, seq. Class.]

582—4. agitur causa, orn. S ; Τ inserts between paucis and verbis;
Bait., Miill. bracket ; Kays. omits. 8. non intellegebant, conj.
Pluygers, punctuating with commas at Oppianicus and Fabricius
(1. 8). 11. ut . . . videretur, ST, Class Ry.; hoc . . . videbatur,
R, Lamb„ Or. The latter reading is absurd: it could only mean,
‘though he did tlzis (that is, stabbed his client’s reputation) to the best
of his power ’: but Cic. could not have attributed to Caepasius a
deliberate design to damage his own case. Nor can sedulo mean ‘in
good saith ’ ; if it could, we might get a fair sense from the reading of R.
