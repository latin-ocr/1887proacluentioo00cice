B.C. 66, before Q. Voconius Naso, who as iudex quaestionis
presided in the Assassination Court (quaestio de sicariis et
veneficzk)‚ an office which was no sinQre at a time when the
social and moral anarchy of Rome was tending rapidly to

Italian township on the northern border of Apulia, was
accused by C. Oppianicus of having procured the death of
several persons by poisoning. These persons were—-

1. Vibius CappadOX, whose heir (it was alleged) Cluentius

2. A young man named Balbutius, who took a draught of
poisoned wine intended for his friend C. Oppianicus (the

3. Statius Albius Oppianicus the elder, father of the
prosecutor Oppianicus the younger, and stepfather of the

with this offence as ‘judicial murder.' True, this clause
