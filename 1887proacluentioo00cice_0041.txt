there are the deputies of Larinum, Teanum, Luceria, >Bovia-
num, and all the country-side, fiocking to Rome to testify
their 'esteem and love for their persecuted countryman. So
general has the exodus been that the defence of Larinum is
at present committed to the women and children !

ἓ 18. F ew will seriously doubt that Cicero has satisfactorily
disposed of the charges of poisoning. There are fiaws in his
reasoning, which probably no one knew better than he himself
did. Thus the argument that the poison must have been
administered in a liquid and not in bread is worthless. And
the orator gives his own version of the story of Oppianicus'
death with some hesitation (de equo cecidisse dicitur, ἕ 17 5), and
without vouchsafing evidence. But then it was only incum-
bent on him to prove the negative of the version given by the
prosecution, Again, with regard to the dep<>sitions of the
slaves, it is quite as likely that he should have refrained from
stating the contents of these, because he was unwilling to
weary his auditors‚ as because he intended to conceal facts.
In fact, unless we are to accept Dr. Bardt⁷s hypothesis, that
this speech was a deliberate, and, as it proved, a successful
attempt to draw a red herring across the trail, it is idle to
imagine that the case of the prosecution, with regard to the
charges of poisoning, was any stronger than Cicero represents
it to have been. Of Cluentius' acquittal there can be little or
no doubt, in view of the boast which is attributed to his advo—
cate by Quintilian—se tenebras offudisse iudicibus in causa

Cluenti.

IV. ΟΝ ΤΗΕ OCCASIONAL COLLOQUIALISM OF CICERo’s STvLE.

So much has been said about the place of Cicero in the
history of Roman literature, and his services to Latin prose,
as sponsor for much of its vocabulary, and perfecter‚ if not
creator, of the ‘ period’ after the best models of Greek prose
writing, that nowadays it is scarcely possible for labourers in
the same field of inquiry to add anything substantial to what
is already known. Leaving therefore the larger portions of
the subject on one side, we propose to call attention to a single
element in the composition of this rich and diversified style,
hitherto perhaps insufficiently noticed. Our examples will
necessarily be taken mainly from the Cluentiana: a larger
induction might yield a more conclusive result.
