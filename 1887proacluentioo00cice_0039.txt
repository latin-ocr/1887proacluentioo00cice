INTRODUCTION. xxxi

The censors had stigmatised several of. these persons on the
ground of their complicity in this public scandal: Popilius,
although in his case that perfect accord in the action of the
two censors, which was essentia] to its value in the argument,
ν was wanting13 Gutta and M. Aquilius 3 and lastly Cluentius
himself.

Then again one Cn. Egnatius had disinherited his son for
the parthe had taken in the same trial. Also, a resolution
of the senate was to be found among the records of that
assembly‚ calling for the appointment of a special commission
to deal with those who were responsible for this rniscarriage of
justice, but nothing came of it. The orator can therefore
fairly urge that the misconduct of his client, which had been
discussed for years in the heated atmosphere of politica]
meetings‚ had only once been the express subject of a judicial
inquiry‚ and on that occasion the verdict had been favourable
to Cluentius.

§14 We pass next to the brief narrative of the deaths of
Vibius Cappadox and Balbutius‚ the latter of which was said
to have taken place at the wedding-breakfast of Oppianicus the
younger. Accius had adduced certain instances of violent
conduct and rapacity, said to have been exhibited by Cluentius
at various times ; this was the probabile ex vita, which was to
prepare the minds of his hearers for the charges which he
hoped to prove. Cicero makes short work of both. He is
evidently no longer on thin ice3 he can afford to be some—
what careless in the reply which he vouchsafes. ‘What has
Habitus ever done ’——thus he deliberately begs the question—
‘to make you think him capable of such a deed ?' The fact
is, ‘res se ipsa defendit.⁷

ἓ 15. But the immediate occasion of the present trial was,
if we are to believe Cicero, the persistent animosity of Sassia
towards her son Cluentius, and her conviction, or at any rate
affirmation, that he had poisoned her husband.

This charge was supported, it would seem, by more serious
arguments than the other charges of poisoning, but although
treated by Cicero at greater length, is scarcely treated more
seriously. These facts, as he narrates them, bring the plot of
the speech (if we may be allowed the expression) to its ghastly

cflbnohuenlzent—-the unnatural mother bringing her son to trial
or is ife.
