146 EXPLANATORY NOTEs. [xxxm. 91

partly subj. in form, partly opt.‚ analogy has unified the syntactic usage of
its tenses.) This Ciceronian usage strikes us indeed as a survival :
Madv, de Fin. ii. 36 gives no post-Ciceronian prose ex. but Liv. xlv.
37. 4. Itis noticeable also that it is negatived by ne, not non : Att. ii.
1. 3, aut ne poposcisses. Hence Pl. T rin. 133, non ego illi argentum
redderem? Non redderes is anomalous. To this Mr. Reid can only say
that in early Latin ne is equivalent to non. The plup. differs from the
imperf. as debuit does from debebat. The following exX. illustrate this
use: Verg. A. iv. 678, sprevisti moriens? eadem me ad fata vocasses:

- ib. viii. 643, at tu dictis, Albane, maneres ; Sest. ἓ 45, forsitan nonnemo

vir fortis . . . dixerit restitisses, repugnasses, mortem pugnans oppetisses.
Cp. Liv. l.c. sub ἓ 60, l. 7. This subj. is treated in much the same
way by R. 1604, r. 6703 Madv. §351, obs. 43 Zumpt, §529 n.; Kiihner
ii. Ι. p. 141. Madv. de Fin. ii. ἓ 36 is a repertory of eXX. V. also Mayor,
Cic. N. D. iii. ἓ 76. It is frequently parallel (as here) to debuit, oportuit,
debebat, oportebat, with inf., and is thus defined by the context as not
being simply potential. If it were, it is not clear why it never expresses
possibility as well as obligation. 12. potestate: cp. ξ 79, l. 1.
91.-—13. Multam petivit: doubtless this was one of those cases in
which, as the offence touched the commonwealth seriously, an indict-
ment could be brought only by a magistrate (as representing the State),
and in which the fine was fixed by statute. Momms. Rom. Staatsr. i.2
178 n. 5. (But this was not a prosecution under the lex Cornelia de
sicariis, as it is there implied.) 14. Like the ordinary magistrate, the
iudex quaestionis had to take an official oath within five days after his
assumption of office3 though, unlike the juror's oath, it wasa mere
formality‚ as we gather from this passage and Verr. i. ἓ 32, hoc animo*
sum ut* eo iudice quam praetore hanc rem transigi malim et iurato suam
quam iniurato aliorum tabellas committere 3 in the latter of which the
praetor is called iniuratus, as far as this same oath is concerned. Cp.
also n. on ἓ 121, iurati. [Ry.‚ however, may be right in supposing
the oath of the iud. quaestionis (as distinguished from the praetor) to
have been more than the ordinary official oath—an oath that he would

administer justice according to the special law under which the trial was
held. The sing. legem makes for this view. Cp. Sest. § 37, of Metellus
refusing to swear to the lex Appuleia, cum unus in legem per vim latam
iurare noluerat, which App. b. civ. i. 29 explains, ἐπομόσαι πεισθήσεσθαι
τῷ volt-qn] V. Momms. Rom. Staatsr. i.² 598. quod in legem non
iurasset ε it has been observed that the action of Quinctius on this occa·
sion seems to prove that the ius accusandi apud plebem was one of the privi-
leges withdrawn from the tribunes by the Sullan legislation. Had it not
been so, probably Quinctius would not have hesitated to impeach Junius
on the direct charge of ‘ judicial murder ’ (hac lege) before the comitia (not
before the appropriate quaestio) ε the objection ‘ at ipse ea lege quaerebat '
would not, of course, have applied in that case (Fritzsche, die Sullan.
