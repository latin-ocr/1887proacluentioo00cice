last held the censorship’: Cn. Cornelius Lentulus and L. Gellius were
censors in 13.C. 70, the office being revived ; Sulla had left it in abeyance.
They signalised themselves by excluding 74 senatorS. 28. cum altero,

118.—30. subscriptio: in affixing the mark (nota) the censor was ex·
pected to assign in writing his reason for doing so (subscribere, ἕ 1 19, l. 12).
Hence subscriptio is the technical term for the censor’s stigma. (Ry.
Rom. Ant. p. 168.) Aulus Gellius (iv. 20) gives two amusing instances.
The censor put a man upon his oath in the formula, ‘ ut tu ex animi tui
sententia uxorem habes? ' ‘ Do you take your oath in good saith, that you
have a wife?' The man could not miss· an opportunity, and replied,
‘ habeo equidem, sed non hercle ex animi mei sententia,' ‘ Ι have, but not
to my liking) For this ill-timed levity he was disfranchised‚ ‘ causamque
hanc ioci scurrilis apud se dicti [censor] subscripsit.' Another, who ap-
peared at the review of ‘ knights with a public horse,' a lean ill-groomed
beast, while he himself looked sleek and plump, was asked by the censor
‘ why he was better kept than his horse Ρ ’ Η6 replied, ‘ Because Ι groom
myself, but my good-for—nothing slave Statius grooms my horse.’ This
wag was similarly ‘in aerarios relatus,’ his want of respect being alleged
in the ‘ subscriptio’ appended to the nota. 32. ratione censoria ε ν.
Glossary. Ratio denotes abstract theory as opposed to facts, viz.
the conduct of those particular censors. 33. a Lentulo: the reserva-
tion of the name is rhetorically effective. He is the alter of ἓ 117.
