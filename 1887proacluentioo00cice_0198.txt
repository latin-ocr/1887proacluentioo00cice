134 EXPLANATORY NOTEs. [xxvn. 74

the pleadings and evidence on both sides were completed was made by the
praeco or erier of the court, and was followed by the consultation of the
jury upon their verdict. Cp. ἓ 55, and n. on ἓ 56, l. 13. So Verr. ii. 2.
75, praeco DIXISSE pronuntiat: and Pseudo-Asconius on Verr. i. ἓ 56,
‘moris veterum fuit, cum satis visum esset fluxisse verborum, hanc sibi
necessitatem finiendae orationis imponere, ut dicerent ad ultimum DIXI 3
quod etiam, ab utraque parte oratione consumpta, ut in consilium dimit-
terentur, praeco solebat pronuntiare DIXERUNT.’

74.—22. In consilium erant ituri, cp. n. on ξ 55. 23. iudices
xxxii ε not (as Manutius supposes) exclusive of Staienus. As we shall see,
there were 32 in the panel ; and Oppianicus hoped to get Staienus' vote·
with that of those whom he was to bribe, that is, to get 17 votes against 15.
(The number of jurors who served for any particular trial was regulated by
the law under which the trial took place : we find examples of 50, 70, 75,
etc.——Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 296.) Sententiis xvi absolutio confici
poterat : it appears that if the votes were even the accused was acquitted ;
17 were secured to make ‘ assurance double sure.' Otherwise the words
mean ‘ 16 votes were enough for an acquittal‚ assuming Staienus' vote to
be safe.' But Zumpt holds that an equality of votes was sufficient for
acquittal (Criminal Proz. p. 367 n.). conficere, so ἓ 69, 1. 27. 25. ad
cumulum, ‘to crown it.' Cumulus is here ‘the crown’ or ‘ summit'
of the heap: so leg. agr. ii. ἓ 62, accesserint z’n cumulum manubiae
vestrorum imperatorum, where z‘n (as ad here) is final in sense, ‘ for.’
So cumulatus: ‘topped with a cumulus‚' τῖε. ‘perfect'3 just as coron-
atus, virgatas, mean ‘with a crown,’ ‘with stripeS.' This sense of
cumulus (which generally denotes the whole lzeap) is clear from ad ‚
Att. xvi. 11. 2 (no. 122 in Watson)‚ de laudibus Dolabellae deruam
cumulum; Marcell. 534, ad tua in me . . . merita . . . maximus hoc tuo
facto cumulus accesserit. In Verg. A. iv, 436 (a passage which still per-
haps awaits a solution), quam mihi curn dederis [v. l. dederit] cumulatam
[ν. l. —ta] morte remittam, this meaning is probable ι ‘ which when you
have granted me, I will repay it z'n full measure at my death,' rather
than ‘with interest' (as generally taken): cumulatus implies ‘good
measure pressed down and running over.’ 28. Staienus ipse non
aderat: ‘observe the loose practice of the Roman courts, which per-
mitted a juror to be absent while the cause on which he sat was actually
in progress.'—Ry. 29. iudicem, an arbitrator in a civil suit. ἓ 120,
neminem voluerunt maiores nostri . . . ne pecuniaria quidem de re
minima esse iudicem, nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset. ‘ In actiones
ordinariae the praetor appointed one or more umpires, for whom the
general term is iudex, to inquire into the facts of the case and to pronounce
judgment, but he previously instructed the iudex as to the points of law
involved,’ in other words, gave him his formula.-Ry. Rom. Ant. p.
276. 32. convicium, v. Glossary. 33. viatores were apparitor-s
attached to certain magistrates. Some, ag. the consuls, had both lictores
