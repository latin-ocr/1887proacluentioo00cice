then that of the censors who ejected him is worthless3 if the sentence of
the censors carries weight‚ then that of Egnatius is worthless‚ sor the
censors left his son in the senate and ejected himself. 30. censoria sub-

the wherefore ’ (Ρ.). Egnatius plays the censor to his own son. Cp. the
use of the adj. in ἓ 129, minime censorium est, ‘is not the thing for a

in consequence of the note of the censorS.’ This abl. however is generally
used to denote an internal cause or motive, as in Verg., neque ipse manus
feritate dedisset (Α. xi. 568) ε not an external cause, which requires a pre·
position except in certain cases: besides one or two instances of ea re,
Draeger only quotes two cases of the simple abl. of external cause stom

TERMs To THE JUNIANUM mmcmM.

XLIX. 136.-—32. The senate might, in the case of some exceptional
offence sor the punishment of which the law did not expressly provide, pass
a resolution that a special commission should be appointed to deal with it ε
‘ut extra ordinem de facinore quaereretur’: if the people ratified this
resolution, a special bill was brought in to regulate the trial. Ry. refers
to the measures adopted aster the death of Clodius for the impeachment
of Milo, B.C. 52 (Ascon. argum. pro Milon. ; Momms. iv. 2, p. 325) ι
Pompey, named sole consul at the instance of the senate, by his law ‘de
vi ' constituted a special quaestio sor the trial of Milo. The Varian quaes-
tio which tried the adherents of Drusus, B.C. 90, and that which tried the
accomplices of Jugurtha, B.C. 109, were similar : except that they were not
established at the suggestion of the senate. In the present instance the
senate suggestS, but the magistrates do not act upon the suggestion.
