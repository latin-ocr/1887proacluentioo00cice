194 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [LVII. 158

158.-—22. si cui . . . facessetur, . . . siis . . . voluerit, me . . . defen-
surum: sor this combination of a prior and wider with a later and
narrower condition—the latter in the present case being expressed by sz·
with the 2d Fut.—cp. ἓ 6, l. 30, n. In ἓ 140 we have a similar ex· with
cum, the tenses being similarly related: cum . . . dq‘enderet . . . cum . . .
recitanda curasset, . . . esse commotus. The indicatives facessetur,
voluerit, are sornewhat irregular in oratio obliqua: but not uncommon
where the governing verb is in the first person. The speaker, from
quoting his own thoughts, slips into direct statement. Cp. defin. i. ἓ 55,
concedo cadere causa, si qui. . . aliter existimant. Cp. 56, 1. 32, n.
25. probaturum: v. Gloss. 25. omni, ‘to the full.'

LVIII.—29. teneatur, here, as above, subj. after consecutive qui
(=talis qui). R. 1680, r. 704. 30. offensus: cp. Hor. Epod. xv. 15,
nec semel offensae cedet constantia formae, ‘ nor will my resolution yield
to beauty which has once become odious to it.’ V. Gloss. effindo.
32. religioni, ‘conscience‚’ ‘reverence for the truth.’ V. Glossary,
and also crit. n. here.

159. —33. tantum, as often, ‘ only so much.' ‘ That he has only been
empowered . . . to the extent of his commission and trust.’ Permit-
titur potestati, committitur fidei et religioni. —MAN. Pago 62, l. 3.
posse, τολμᾶν, the wisc juror must ‘ have the strength of mind to ' neglect
personal likes and dislikes. P. is wrong ς ‘ he must bethink himself that
it is open to him to . . .’ Cp. Hor. C. iii. 11. 31, impiae sponsos potuere
duro perdere ferro. 10. habere in consilio, cet. This metaphorical
language is rather the terminology of the tribunal of the special iudex
nominated by the praetor than that of the quaest. perpetua. Such a special
iudex would have assessors to advise him on points of laW‚ etc. ι cp. Prop.
v. 11. 19-21, aut si quis posita iudex sedet Aeacus urna . . . Adsideant
fratres (as Mr. Postgate explains it). 11. libidinem, ‘ caprice.’ 12. con-
scientiam m. suae, ‘the approval of his own conscience 'z v. Glossary.
15. sine ulio metu et summa cum honestate: the effect of the order of
the words is (as in neque . . . et. . ., and similar combinations) to throw
an emphasis on to the latter member. ‘ Not only proof against all alarms,
but in the perfect possession of virtue.’ Metus, religious or moral
apprehension (H. N. ap. P.). Verg. G. ii. 491, atque metus omnes et
inexorabile fatum Ι subjicit pedibus.

160.—18. egit : of course not ‘ has done,' in the representative sense of
fecit, but ‘ has urged ’ : as in agere cum populo, actio, etc. 20. ‘ If 1
>am to regard Cluentius's wishes, too much, if the importance of the subject,
too little, but sor men of your intelligence, sufficient.' For dignitate
v. Gloss. 21. videor, ‘ I seem to myself‚' i.e. ‘ I feel ' or ‘ think.’ So
in Verg. frequently : ag. possunt quia posse videntur.
