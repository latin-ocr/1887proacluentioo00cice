220 CRITICAL NO‘sEs. [ma-1³01). ²

of original emendation. Their aim has been to supply the student with
data sufficient to enable him to form an independent judgment on the
value of the chief MSS. and on the variants which they supply. Some
prominence has been given to considerations which, it is thought, do not ‘
always receive the attention due to them. These are, in the first place,
the value of a parallel passage in confirmation of any given reading, par-
ticularly if it be taken from the same speech or a speech belonging to the
same period of the author's literary life. This principle is illustrated in
the notes on ἓ 18, reticeri, 558, ut videretur, ἓ 78, Staieno, 5 112, quaero,
and elsewhere. In the second place, grammatical considerations, or
rather considerations of Ciceronian grammar, may turn the scale some-
times. Cp. the notes on ἓ 9, ni ; 5 33 (the ‘ vivid construction ’) ; 5 122,
iubeo, with simple infin.; 5 141, et ipse, etc. Thirdly, there are rhetorical
considerations, such as the pointing of an antithesis. Examples will be
found in 5 16 (matre repeated), 5 32 (plures rejected as a piece of false
antithesis), 55 146, 157, and so on. These and other considerations will
be found, I think, as a general rule though not invariably, to make for
the text of ST, to which accordingly I have on the whole adhered.
Unfortunately we cannot rely implicitly on ST, or even on P ; all three are
capable of glaring blunders.

Lastly, the student may, if he has the mind, gather instances of most of
the errors and confusions common in MSS. in the course of a careful exam-
ination of the text of this speech. For example, in 55 20, 23, 30 we
have instances of the loss of initial e, M, e, respectively after final e, m, e z
this is ‘haplography.’ Compare 5 140, quasi si. Again, in 5 37, pernoc-
tarat et (FM) is a case of ‘dittography.⁷ Then again we have the con-
fusion oscum and quam, 55 68, 181 3 ipso and isto, cum and tam, 5 1403
ut and ne, 5 1503 sz't and est, 5 1483 ad and apud, 5 171 ; adhuc and ab
hoc, 5 183 ; vobis and nobis, 5 1843 superlative and positive, 5 202; indic.
and subj., 55 149, 181 ; act. and pass., 5 1833 sing. and plur„ 5 196; the
confusion of endings -ant and -at‚ 5 72; the loss of est after -us, 5 181.
These instances are taken at random‚ but the list might be enlarged and
arranged to form a useful ‘ gradus ad criticen.’
