, qui distulit: ‘ by voting not proven a juror virtually demanded a further

hearing of the case' (P. ). ‘Is held to have been interested . . . politic
. . consistent.'
XXXIX-23. per: for this instrumental use v. n. on ἓ 25; owing
to the excited mob no speaker could hold his ground' or ‘command a

- hearing.' For consistere cp. ἓ 193 n. 24. pervertit, ‘upset,'

zze. ‘ ruined ’ z :pessum dedit in older Latin, which is surely the same
etymologically. L. and Sh. derive pessum from pedis-norsum, ‘brought
towards the feet,' i.e. ‘to the ground ⁷: Vanicek says that pessum--ped-
tum (‘ ground,' of same root as με, oppidum, pessimus) ε the latter deriva-
tion requires a simpler phonetic change. But the analogy of the assimi-
lated forms russum (same as rursum, z'.e. re·uorsum), szisum (sursum, sub·
uorsum), retrosum (retrorsum, retro-norsum), all containing a propositional
clement, points to per-uersum (persum) pessum ε per having the same force
as in perdo pereo. (Thus either phrase is used of the sinking of a ship, Pl.
Rud. ii. 3. 64, cum navi scilicet abiisse pessum in altum ; Pl. Epid. i. l. 70,
puppis pereundast probe.) For the loss of r, cp. peiere. 25. paucis
uns diebus z for this abl. of ‘time in the course of which ' v. n. on ἓ 22.
26. defervisse, ‘ had cooled down.' De- gives the idea of doing a thing to
tlte end :hence (a) to tlze utmost point : so in Hor.‚ qua parte debacchentur
ignes, ‘where raves the fire unrein'd‚' Conington (C. iii. 3. 55), ventos
aequore fervido deproeliantes (C. i. 9. 11); dum pelago desaevit hiems,
‘ rages itsfillss Verg. A. iv. 52. (b) ‘ to tlze vanislzz'ng point ’ : z'.e. to cease
to do: nec dum desaeviat ira exspecta, Luc. V. 3043 depuduit, ‘1 have
done with modesty‚’ Ov. Her. iv. 155. ›

of the upstart who finds himself in a position to which he is unaccustomed.
spiritus, ‘ pride,' always in a bad sense in good prose: Sull. §27, res
enim gestae, credo, meae . . . mihi nescio quos spiritus attulerunt.
32. ‘ How insufferable he was,’ equivalent to the words of ἓ 1 10, quanto
in odio . . . suis . . . fuit. The commentators refer, for this passive use
of odium, to Plaut. Asin. ii. 4. 6, iam hic me abegerit suo odio (=0dz'osa
importunitate, Lamb.) ; Hor. Serm. i. 7. 6, durus homo atque odio qui
possit vincere Regem ; in both, however, the shade of meaning is different:
‘ tediousness,' asin the conversational odiosus, ‘ a bore.' ignorantia:
v. crit. n. Pago 42, l. 2. condonatum: ‘that Opp. had not been

tlilardoned out of consideration for himself and the defence he made.' So
