r. 525b.¹ ‘Prejudice which the trial before Junius has left.’ In ἓ 128,
flagitium rei militaris=flagitium in re m. admissum ι another variety
of this genitive. Invidia <originally the ‘fascination' of the evil eye)
is used in a passive sense, ‘unpopularity‚' as well as in an active sense,
‘ ill·will,' ‘ prejudice‚' aegritudo suscepta propter alterius res secundas quae
nilzz'l nocent invidenti (Cic. T usc. iv, ἓ 17). The idea of unfairness per·
sists in the word ε it is never a mere synonym of Lat. odium. 4. consue-
tudinis causa, ‘ for mere form's sake.' 5. rationem, the ‘ consideration‚’
or ‘ question ² : V. Glossary. 6. quaestio, ‘ court of inquiry' t one of the
quaestiones perpetuae, or ‘ standing jury-courts ' z in this case, the q. inter

r. 525 a. ‘ Accordingly I am resolved to follow his example in my defence,
and to treat of this prejudice and these charges separately, trusting thus
to make it apparent to every one that it has been my desire throughout

words.' Contrast the orator's boast when the trial was over: Se tenebras
offudisse iudicibus in causa Cluenti gloriatus est.—Quint. ii. 17. 21.
et sometimes connects the members of a divided whole. Invidia,
crimina, are the proposed divz'sz'ons of the speech. In such a context et
takes a quasi-disjunctive force, and in some constructions must be trans-
lated accordingly: e. g. Tac. A nn. ii. 66, ius et iniuriam discreturos,
‘distinguish right from wrong.’ Hence its use in comparisons, as in

between them by the grammatical figure called coniunctio : cp. pp. 1, l. 8·:

3.—17. For the argument of the following passage, v, crit. n. It
must be observed that the regimen of quod extends to de invidia . . .
