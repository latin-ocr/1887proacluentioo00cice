xxviii INTRODUCTION.

not demonstratively proved: at any rate five jurors, whom-
Cicero does not venture to accuse of corruption, did not recog-
nise the obligation of those previous verdicts (ἕ 76). And if
the N. L. voters were so convinced of the guilt of Oppianicus

as Cicero would have us suppose, it is scarcely likely that the

mere suspicion that some of their less worthy colleagues were ⁷
about to vote the right way from wrong motives would have de—
termined them to suspend their vote of Guilty. Altogether the
want of precise statement as to the composition of the vote
which condemned Oppianicus is unsatisfactory z there is not a
hint (in this speech) of the narrowness of the majority by
which he was found guilty.1 Again it is the knaves who give
the right verdict‚ the honest men who withhold it or give the
wrong verdict‚ if Cicero is to be believed. Staienus's behaviour
is also an enigma. How could he have staked his ‘spes
maiorum praemiorum' (ἓ 74) on the precarious (or, as the
event showed, hopeless)< chance of embezzling the 640, 000
sesterces in case Oppianicus was condemned? Had not Op-

pianicus powerful friends, such as Quinctius, to act in his behalf
in that contingency? It cannot of course be questioned that
money passed from Oppianicus to Staienus,‚since it was a no-
torious fact that after the trial the former recovered it, though,
be it observed, we do not read that he recovered precisely
640‚000 sesterces (ἓ 78). But we are free to conjecture that
money did also pass from Cluentius to Staienus 3 in fact that .
the former outbid Oppianicus, and that the latter therefore left
him in the lurch for something more substantia] than the
chance of embezzling the deposit. This may help to explain
his absence from court when Cannutius called for the verdict‚
The prosecution were confident of a majority without him
(having secured, as we shall see, Fidiculanius Falcula) 3 the
defence could not spare him. He himself naturally arranged
to be absent from court, knowing what Cannutius meant to
do, and not wishing to create a sensation by his vote, or. to
lose the sesterces of Oppianicus. But Quinctius, acting for
Oppianicus, forced him to return. On this theory the conduct

1 Zumpt indeed sees an argument in this for the view that Cluentius
bribed. Leaving the N. L. voters out of account (who could not be
reckoned upon), 16 votes were enough to ensure acquittal (ξ 74). But
17, we know from Cic„ laid themselves open to corrupt offers And we
have proved that 17 did actually convzct. The inference 15 obvious to us,
and Z. thinks it would have been obvious to the' Jury, if Cic. had supplied
them with the second premis 5 (Ζ. Cri'zmmala 11 1),1). 128.129).
