CRITICAL NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΤΕΧΤ.

Pago 1, INSCRIPTION. Habito. So SF and almost all others. Avito,
first suggested by Cuiacius, from a mistaken impression that the Florentine
MS. of the Pandects (48. 19, 39) reads thus, and also because the name is
common in Inscr.; first introduced into the text by Lambinus in his
edition of 1566. But Habitus appears as a Roman cognomen in more
than one Inscr., also in the Fasti Capitolini, thus ‘A. VIBIVS C. F. c. N.
HABITVS ’ (consul of the second half-year A.D. 8). Moreover‚ it is read in
all MSS. of Quintilian in iv, 2. 16, v. 10. 68. (V. Bait. crit. n. ad ἓ 201.)

1. 1.—The Turin palimpsest (P) contains ἓ 1 to ‘ quam aequum iudicium ’
ing-¹, 7. 4. alteram, P.

2.-10. pars est ea quae, STM ; pars quae, F. The et in the text is

due to P alone. Ramsay, following Lambinus and Orelli, reads pars ea
quae. -
3.--16. in hac difficultate, PS (pr. m.) T ; in hac tanta diff„ R, includ-
ing S (sec. m.), and so Ry. 18. omnium, P. So Klotz, Miiller.
22. voa, STF ; 1108, PM, and some inferior MSS. ‘ Quaenam haec est iudi—
cum inter se disceptatio? Ii vero tabellis tacite sententiam ferebant
neque inter se, verum inter accusatorem et reum disceptabant. Cp. Liv.
i. 50, Plin. Ep. vii. 15, de lnv. i. 3. Quod autem sequitur anobis de Accio
simul et Tullio dicitur ; esset enim, si de se tantum ipso a Tullio diceretur,
absurdum. Legendum inter 1108, ut habet codex meus.' Garatoni,
quoted by Baiter. This reasoning ‘is by no means convincing. It
is quite true that the jurors voted by ballot, but this circumstance would
not preclude discussion' [Ramsay]. The sentence contains a careful
antithesis, ‘ In the matter of direct charges, your practice is to throw the
whole (omnem) burden of refutation upon the advocate : in the matter os Ι,
prejudice, to supplement the advocate’s imperfect statement from your
own duly debated convz‘ctz'ons’ (this is the sense of ‘inter vos disceptare,’
which is chosen in preference to ‘iudicare ’ in order to contrast
independent activity of mind with mere receptivity: inter vos)(a
nobis). 1 therefore follow Class. and Ry. in reading omnem . . .
inter-vos. Pago 2, l. 5. Classen would omit ac. Baiter brackets ac
81116, which Halm and Garatoni omit. It would be better to bracket
sine alone. But even this change practically lacks all MS. support. Prof.
Nettleship conj. vestro talium virorum: ‘ of such men as you.'

4.—7. After vertam Klotz introduces iudices from Martianus Capella
(v. ἓ 523), and Romanus Aquila (de Fz‘g. Sent. ἓ 10), who both cite the
passage in this form; which Gar. approves. But Quintilian (ix, 2. 19,
and 4. 75) supports the Mss. In the same line Quint. omits illam.
8. Some inferior MSS. omit esse. So Ry.

II. 5.—15. veritas, PSTM ε falsitas (F, and early edd.)‚ a misguided
