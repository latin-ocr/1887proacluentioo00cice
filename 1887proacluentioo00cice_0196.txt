of Trimalchio in Petronius 33) at the beginning of the cena (the gustatio).
Hence the perversity of Staienus in beginning with Bulbus—‘ Then again
this master in cookery (conditor totius negotii, another pun, as conditor
may come from condire or condere) adds a dash of Gutta-seasoning to ,
his vegetable friend Bulbus: so that (ἓ 72, ll. 29, 30) those who got a tidbit

of promise from the latter voted him a very palatable sellow.' Peterson

doubts the pun in condz'tor3 but surely coudz'sset (ἓ 72, 1. 10) leaves it

beyond a doubt. Ry. says that gutta signifies a narrow-necked flask from

which the fluid does not flow, but drop. I know of no authority for this

statement as to the use of gutta z guttas (or gutus) is thus used, e.g. Hor.

Serm. i. 6. 118, cum patera gutus. Prof. Nettleship suggests (Journal
ῳ( Philology, vol. xiii. no. 25, p. 75) that gutta may here=orarcr⁷53

it is glossed somewhere by unguentum. He cp. with the expression

in§ 71, Guttam aspergit huic Bulbo, the Greek proverb τὸ ἐπὶ τῇ φακῇ

‘yawning': he was famished and miserable. 22. tmpelnt, ‘gently

touches him up.' So in Verg. of the friendly push which a deity gives to

a ship‚ A. Χ. 246, dextra discedens impulit altam, Ι haud ignara modi,

puppim. Quid tu? sc. aiS, ⁴ I say.' So osten in comedy, sed
quid ais? or quid ais tu .? prop. ‘ what have you to say (to the remark Ι

am going to make) ’? Plaut. Mil. Glor. 358. In Capt. 270 we have

quid tu ‚9 seruosne esse an liber mauefis, memora mihi. 24. ne graus:

the same litotes in leg. agr. ii. ξ 58, quod regi amieo cavet, non reprehendo:

quod non gratis fit indignor. 29. Cicero was a famous, and even notorious,

wit. ‘ Noster vero non solum extra iudicia sed in ipsis etiam orationibus

habitus est nimius risus affectator,’ Quint. vi. 3. 3. He had a habit of at-

tributing his jests to other people: e.g. in the famous instance, Verr. ii. ,
1. 121, hinc homines erant qui etiam ridiculi inveniebantur ex dolore:

quorum alii . . . negabant mirandum esse, ius (‘broth ’ or ‘justice ’) tam

nequam esse verrinum. V. also ad Att. i. 16 (no. 8 in Watson’s Selection,

ξ 10), for the famous altercation between Cic. and Clodius in the senate.

In de Orat. ii. ἓ 220, we read that L. Philippus, the consul, asked Q.

CatuluS, a distinguished noble, ‘ quid latras, Catule?' [catulus=puppy]:

who replied, furem se videre. This may seem to us undignified jesting,

except for young schoolboys. But Italian wit revelled in personalities:

cp. the cognomina Naso (big-nosed), Habitus (stout), Flaccus (flap-eared)‚

Balbus (stammerer), etc.
