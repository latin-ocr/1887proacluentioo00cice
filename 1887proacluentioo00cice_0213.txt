xxxv. 95] EXPLANATORY NoTEs. 149

-bz'lisz Verr. ii. 3. 98, ne contemptissimi ac despicatissimi esse videamur.
Such participles are frequently in this sense compounded with z‘n-, as z'n·
victus, indomitus, inaccessos lucos (Verg. A. vii. 12). So the Greek verbals
in -τός acquire the notion of possibility ι and a few perf. paSS. participles :
Hom. Il. xiv, 196, εἰ τετελεσμένον ἔσται. Α thing once done may be done
again. putarent . . . putarunt: the change of mood is instructive,
cp. ἓ 89, l. 26; R. 1744, tenth ex„ r. 740, 2, fifth ex. 17. cognatis,
adfinitum, ‘ relations by blood,' ‘ connections by marriage ' ; v. Ry. Rom.
Ant. pp. 265, 267. In such context as this necessarii means ‘intimate
friends ' who are not connected with a man by ties of blood or marriage.
Cp. its use in ἓ 43, suorum municipum ceterorumque necessariorum; so
in ξ 87. But it may be applied to a relation, Muren. ξ 73, virgo
Vestalis huius propinqua et necessaria. The same holds as to necessitudo :
in ἓ 117 it denotes ‘intimate friendship,' in§ 199 the ‘ties of mar--
riage.’ 21. criminosus, ‘scurrilous,’ ‘ litigious': in a bad sense, as
Hor. C. i. 16. 2: quem criminosis cunque voles modum Ι pones iambis.

XXXV. 95.-30. conflata, ‘when prejudice is blown into a flame and
public meetings are worked up to disloyalty' (not as Ρ., who takes con-
flata in agreement with vis). For this sense of conflata v. n. on ἕ 9.
32. iactatione populari, not, as Sylva, ‘by a popular disturbance,’ but
‘bidding for-popularityss ‘posing as the people’s frz'enczZ' The verbal
phrase is se iactare. So Sest. ἓ 114, ita se in populari ratione iactarat3
Verg. A. vi. ω 817, iactantior Ancus Ι nunc quoque iam nimium fidens
*popularibus auris. GraeV. compares ad Fam. viii. 10, Curionem video se
dupliciter iactaturum, ‘ will curry favour (with the optimates) in two wayS.'
Juv. i. 62, ipse lacernatae cum se iactaret amicae. Pago 37, l. 1. P.
Popilius, consul B.C. 132, presided over the prosecutions of Tib. Gracchus’
adherents3 went into exile when C. Gracchus passed his law de provocatione,
which was made retrospective 3 was recalled by the tribune L. Calpurnius
Bestia in B.C. 121 after C. Gracchus’ death. Momms. iii. pp. 95, 118,
132. Q. caecilius Metellus NumidicuS, who won his agnomen in
the Jugurthine war, was more than once marked out sor attack by the
democratic tribune L. Appuleius Saturninus: alone of the senators he
refused to take the oath to observe the leges Appuleiae, and went into
exile in consequence. Momms. iii. pp. 207, 211. Cp. also ἓ 24,
11. 2. ms temp-gripun . . . t abl. of circumstance. R. 1242, r. 504, 1.
Cp. Pl. T rin. ii. 4. 83, cena hac annonast sine sacris hereditas, ‘with
our present prices a dinner is an unencumbered inheritance.’—‘ In our
degenerate day, with such morals and such magistrates. ' 3. sine . . .
ac sine . . . ε for the repetition of the proposition with a synonymous
phrase, and its attachment by ac, cp. ἓ 3, sine vestro ac sine talium virorum
subsidio: ubi ν. 11. These words contain the condition upon which
possimus depends. ‘If it were not for your wisdom and the salutary
action of the law-courts we could not be safe.' R. 1534, r. 642. Or
possimus depends on nedum : R. 1658, r. 688.
