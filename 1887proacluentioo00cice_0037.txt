sos Staienus and his confederates accords with the conduct of

Verres, whom Cicero himself accuses of having similarly
accepted bribes from both partieS, favoured the higher bidder,
and refused to return the money of the other.1

511. To return to the narrative. The penalty was out-
lawry (aquae et zgm's interdictio), the heaviest which was
generally inflicted upon a Roman citizen in republican timeS,
involving as it did the practical loss of caput. Cicero’s elo-
quence revels in the description of the forlorn and wandering
life of one who was civilly, though no longer in a religious
sense, under a ban. But the miseries of this banishment
were not without their alleviation 3 it was passed not in the
bleak solitude of some Tomi, but in the fairest district of
Italy, the exile might at times find a welcome at the villa of
an old friend such as Quinctius, and he even rented some
sort of lodging at the very gates of Rome. Sassia, t00, did
not altogether desert him, though she is accused of unfaithful-
ness to her husband, who heard of it through a trusty slave
called Nicostratus. About two years after his trial Oppianicus
died at his suburban lodging, ofinjuries sustained by a fall from
his horse, or, as Sassia professed to believe, and as the pro-
secutor alleged, of poison administered to him in bread by
one M. Asellius, at the instance of Cluentius. At the same
time it is worthy of remark that he had been for a long time in

“ failing health.

This was in the year B.C. 72. The friends of Oppianicus at
Rome had not meanwhile been idle, especially as political
feeling reinforced personal considerationS. A series of pro—
secutions was instituted against the guilty, or presumably
guilty, jurors and judge‚ and Cluentius himself became the
object of intense popular dislike (invidia).

ἕ 12. It is not necessary to enter very minutely into these
prosecutions, most of which ended in convictions, urged in
the present trial by the prosecution as so many recorded
verdicts against Cluentius (ἓ 88).

iudicandam pecuniam accipere, quanto illud flagitiosius . . . eum a quo
pecuniam ob absolvendum acceperis, condemnare? . . . scelus est accipere

ab reo, quanto magis ab accusatore ? quanto enim sceleratius ab utroque?
. . . Cum vero fidem ac religionem tuam iam alteri addictam pecunia
accepta habueris, post eandem adversario tradideris maiore pecunia, ei
quem fefelleris, ne pecuniam quidem reddes? quem mihi tu Bulbum, quem
Staienum? quod umquam huiusce modi monstrum aut prodigium audivi-
mus aut vidimus, qui cum reo transigat, post curn accusatore decidat ?
