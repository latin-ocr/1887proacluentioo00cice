xxv. 68] EXPLANATORY NOTEs. 129

guardians and lost his case, Staienus having embezzled 600,000 sesterces
placed in his hands for the purpose of bribing the jury (cp. ξ 69, illo
absoluto . . . neminem, which refers to the experience of Staienus in the
iud. Iunianum). Staienus then kept the money to himself (suppressit) ;
neither Safinius nor the purchasers of the estate (bonorum emptores) got
any of it. (So Mr. Roby understands the passage. The close analogy of
the conduct of Staienus in the iud. Iunianum makes it probable that the
case went against Safinius.) Atell'ae might be taken as locative, ‘ at A.'
eausam . . . recepisset: in ἐξ 49, 136 we have the commoner phrase
causam suscipere. As far as we can distinguish the words, recipere
implies that something is undertaken as of oblzgratz‘on5 vsuscipere is a
voluntary undertaking. Or again, recipere is to undertake an office with
a sense of responsibility‚ which suscipere does not necessarily imply: so
here. Cp. Div. in Caec. ἓ 26, ego in hoc iudicio mihi Siculorum causam
receptam, populi Romani susceptam esse arbitror (cp. reff. in Heitland
and Cowie's n.). Madv. (defin. i. ἓ 68) says, recipiuntur tantum ea quae
demandata et tradita sic suscipimus ut promittamus aliquid et rationem
debeamus. 14. nec bonorum emptoribus : The b. emptores (or emptor)
were persons (or a person) who bought, not certain articles, but the whole
estate of the deceased or the bankrupt, and had of course afterwards to
collect the credits and defray the debts. The money given by Safinius
to Staienus presumably was part of the estate, sold, and therefore
belonged either to Safinius, if the sale was upset, or to the purchasers,
if it was upheld—-On bon. emptor V. Gai. iii. ξ 78: Cic. Quinct. §60—
[H. J. R.] 15. non modo (non) . . . sed ne . . . quidem: cp. ξ 9,
1. 4 n. 17. suppressiones iudiciales, The Lat. adj. is often
used to correspond with the gen. of the subst. in its various usages,
especially when the subst. in question is generic in sense 3 in other
words, when if sing. it takes the indefinite article in English, if plur.
takes no article. Here iudiciales answers to iudiciorum, a gen. equivalent
to a prepositional phrase, ‘in trials.’ For other instances of the adj.
answering to a gen. cp. ἓ 61, iudicia senatoria=senatorum, subjective gen. 3
ἓ 77, invidia senatoria=senatus‚ objective gen. ; ἓ 123, dictatorium stilum
=dz‘ctatoris, possessive gen. The use of the adj. for the plural gen. has
not been sufficiently noticed: eng. Sest. ἓ 115, theatrales gladiatoriique
consessus compared with ib. ἓ 106, ludorum gladiatorumque consessu,
infr. ἓ 123, subscriptio censoria=censorum. 18. iugulatum, a strange
metaphor to us: lit. ‘ with the throat cut': we might say colloquially‚
‘knocked on the head by the two previous verdicts.’ So Mil. ἓ 31,
optabilius Miloni fuit dare iugulum P. Clodio . . . quam iugulari avobis.
The defendant may be said to be laqueis legum constrictus: when con-
demned, to be iugulatus. Cp. also ἓ 84, cum saucibus premeretur.
20. saluti desperare: so Mur. §45 quoniam sibi hic ipse desperat. The
common construction is the accus. : Δίαν. ἓ 43, ut honorem desperasse
videatur3 sometimes the verb takes de with abl., especially in Caesar.
