86 EXPLANATORY NOTEs. [ιν. 9

use of the pronoun or pronominal adverb (illa 1. 21, sic 1. 22) to anticipate

a dependent sentence (which serves as its epexegesis) is very idiomatic ε it
gives rhetorical emphasis and distinetness, indicating as it does at the

outset the course which the sentence will take. The degree of emphasis
varies according to the context. Examples from this speech are id antici-

pating Ace. and 1nf.,⁹§ 138 init. : id que, ut facerem (oblique petition) §49
fin. : hoc followed by ut in the Subj.‚ by Acc. and .Inf. (here less empha-‘
tic), by Acc. and Inf. (emphatic by contrast to non lcoc, ut . . above)

§303 hoc followed by indirect question ἓ 124 init.: illud by Inf. ἓ 10,

by finite verb ἕ 89, illud unum by Ace. and Inf. ἕ 1 19 ι by indirect ques—

tion, ἓ 123 init. : by quod with Subj, ξ 10. eiusmodi followed by ut c.

Subj. ἓ 135. Compare the use of unum, followed by Ace. and Inf.

ἓ 169 init. Eum fuisse, qui . . ἓ 125; eis criminibus . . . ut . . ξ 20,

where ez‘sztalibus, is an instance of the highest degree of emphasis z ita ut

. . ἓ 112 et passim ε sz‘c quasi ἕ 4: ideo quia§ 123 : idcirco ut . . ἓ 146 :‘
sic with Inf. ἓ 47 init. (v. n.) Two extreme instances may illustrate the
wide applicability of the principle: de Nat. Deorum, i. ἓ 38, quo quid

absurdius quam res sordidas atque informes deorum honore afficere? where
quo, the abl. of comparison, is explained by quam with Inf. Rosc. Am.

ἕ 60, usque eo . . . antequam. 24. Hodierno die : this pleonasm may
have been due to the influence of the expressions pridie eius diei, post-

ridie eius diei : besides hesterno die for heri. 25. ipsius criminis, v,

crit. n. 26. ‘ Until now misconeeption and prejudice have been ram-

pant in the case.’

IV. 9.—30. iudicium, ‘jury' 3 v. Glossary. 31. quo as a final
' particle (=ut eo) is rare except in conjunction with a comparative
(as in quominus). Still it does occur without a comparative in the best
Latin: and is common in Sallust, eng. Cat. 23, nos arma neque contra
patriam cepisse neque quo periculum aliis faceremus, where v. Mr. Cook's
note for other eXX. : Ter. Andr. 472 ; ἓ 140, quo animi illorum iudicum . . .
incenderentur3 Sest. ἓ 93, villa quam tribunus pl. pictam . . . explicabat,
quo fortissimum civem in invidiam vocaret: Verr. ii. 1. 17, cum iste
atque istius amici . . . sermones . . . dissipassent, quo, animos testium
retardarent. In the present instance, the words recur with little altera-
tion in the subscriptio of the censor L. Gellius, ἓ 131, ‘quod is pecuniam
accepisset, quo innocentem condemnaret.' They are evidently a remin-
iscence of the lex Cornelia quoted in ἓ 148, ‘quo quis iudicio pub-
lico condemnaretur‚' in which the construction occurs a second time if
the words quoted in Bruns' footnote are genuine. Madv. 440, b. 1.1
