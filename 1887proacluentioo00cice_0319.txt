XLV. 127] CRITICAL NOTES. 255

scribae.' [Cp. Liv. xliv, 27, 1, cum suadere non consulenti nemo audeat;
Sen. Rhet. Controv„ ii. 12, p. 173, Bip. rem non controversiae3 quoted
by Madv. l.c. infra]

ι (iii.) Madvig (Emend. Lz'v. p. 698, on xliv, 27. Ι) reads, combining
these, aut fflud adferant, aliquid sese, quod. de his duobus habuerint

⁷ compertum, de ceteris non comperisse: which I have adopted. So

Kays., Miill. Taking (i.) first—As Class. explains it, the line of thought
will be-What is the meaning of this stigma upon Aquilius and Gutta?
The censors must tell us (dz·cant): it is that two only of the jurors were
bribed. Or else let them produce evidence (afferant), that the fault
visited by them⁷upon two was committed by the rest. For (nam illud. . .
ἓ 128), they ,will not venture to tell us ‘all were equally involved, but
we arbitrarily selected two for notatio) This interpretation of aut illud
afferant—comperisse, is criticised by Ry. as inconsistent with ‘ nam
illud . . .' and what immediately follows. If it is worth our while to
defend an erroneous reading in order to vindicate its many supporters,
we might reply that ‘nam ' is elliptic in this case: ‘Or else let them
argue that while punishing two they knew that the rest were guilty: [but
this alternative cannot be accepted]: foi· it cannot be allowed that the
censors could have adopted the rough and ready military method of
decimation.’ But we should expect idem for aliquid : nor does adferant
seem to be the right word. As to (ii.), the sense given is much the same
as that of (iii.) ε the sentence is not so smooth. At the same time it is
not necessary to suppose (with Mr. Peterson) a harsh attraction, non
comperisse for non comperem‘nt3 nor is the omission of the subject se at
all unprecedented, cp. ξ 36 n. Comperisoe would depend directly
on adferant. ‘Or else let them assert (which would be absurd), that
they have discovered something peculiarly heinous in the conduct of these
two; that as to the rest, they have not discovered anything.’ With (iii.)
all is clear. There are three alternatives: the censors must say that two
only were guilty : or else that two at least were guilty, and on the rest they
cannot pronounce. For (nam illud . . .) a third supposition that,
knowing that all were guilty, they made scapegoats of these two, cannot
be admitted. (This is substantially Ry.'s view: although in his text
he exhibits the MS. reading.) [(iv.) An emendation by Mr. Davies
(Hernzatlz. ii. 408), merits mention. He emends the MS. reading with
comparasse for comperisse: translating ‘else we must suppose that the
allegation is, that the censors had found out material facts about the
guilt of those two persons, and lzaa' come to a private agreement that the
rest were also guilty.' comparasse, he says, is technical (as in sortitio et
comparatio): but we want proof of its absolute use in this sense: unfor-
tunately he says that illustration is hardly required, and proof is super-
fluous. He does vouchsafe Cic. Fam. i. 9, se paraturum cum collega
‘that he would make things straight with his colleague.’ This emenda·
tion will not stand against Madvig's.]
