xm. 36] CRITICAL NOTES. 229

Kays.‚ K1., Miill. Multos would be a tasteless exaggeration: Oppi-
anicus had killed two in one person3 zle. stating it as vaguely as
possible to make the most of it, plures ; ‘more than one.’ Some one
introduced multos, thinking to sharpen the antithesis.

and Ry. salvum parere posset: P has been credited (owing to an
error of Peyron, its original collator) with the reading parere et posset.
The real readingof P is salvom parere posset. S has possit, which is
very likely right3 cp. n. on l. 6, §41‚ 1. 23, ἓ49, 1. 32, ἓ69, l. 24, ἓ 134,

says, the relative is wanted to correspond to the pronoun eum in the
apodosis. So in the corresponding sentence below, quae pecunia antici-
pates eam. Cum was introduced in order to justify the subj., which is
sufficiently explained by the causal force of the relative. Cp. ἓ 40, cui
. . . restarent. 9. non longe, ST b (corr.), Class, Kays.; longe, R,
Ry., Bait„ Mun„ Kl. Ry. however admits that the former reading has
much in its favour, and ‘may be interpreted so as to give additional
force to the passage ’ : he rejects it on the ground that the meaning given
‚is ‘too subtle for a public speaker addressing a jury.’ A subjective test
of this kind does not go very far ε the subtleties with which ἓξ 28 and 32
close are surely more refined. (In ἐξ 47, 127 we have similar instances
of the loss of non in MSS.) The gist of the whole passage is this:
Magius had an inkling of Oppianicus' intentions, and provided accord-
ingly. But how inadequate his precautions proved to be! His utmost
foresight was short-sighted in the face of such enterprising villainy. There
is a general parallelism between the sentences: quia . . . ascripsit-
expressing the precautions of Magius—is answered by quid . . . appel-
landa est, expressing the audacity of Oppianicus. 23. Pluygers suggests
’ nondum debitam, as in better keeping with praesentem. The money
was only due after the delivery of the woman.

l. 1, Asuvius is read by PSTM, as in 1. 3ο Μ has Asuvii, and ἓ 37,

have quam clara. tum recenti fuit, which is interesting as the first de-
viation (re being dropped from its similarity to the first syllable of recenti),
which was corrected into the reading of ST, which makes it intelligible‚
