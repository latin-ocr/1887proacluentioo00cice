xxvi INTRODUCTION.

counsel for Cluentius, got wind of bribery, and, thinking to
steal a march upon the other side, exercised what seems to
have been the right of the prosecution, and called for the
close of the pleadings. It is a significant fact that Staienus'was
not in court at the time. The tribune L. Quinctius, advocate
of OppianicuS‚ used his official power to bring him up to vote.
By Oppianicus' choice the voting was open. What was his
dismay when Staienus, Bulbus, Gutta, on whom the lot
happened to fall first, voted Guilty! Many of the other
jurors, unable to conceive that this worthy trio could vote
otherwise than as they were paid to vote, supposed that
Cluentius had bribed, and therefore voted Not Proven,
preferring to reserve judgment before condemning one who,
however guilty, might not have had fair play in his trial. Of
the remainder, the rest of the corrupt seventeen took their
cue from Staienus and convicted: five only voted Not
Guilt . -

ξ 9).1 There is some difficulty in determining the exact pro-
portions which made up this vote, the result of which was that
Oppianicus was condemned by a narrow majority. In the pro
Caec. ξ 29, Cicero says of this verdict, and of the conduct of
Fidiculanius Falcula, one of the jurors in particular: ‘ In eum
quid dicam nisi id, quod negare non possit, venisse in con-
silium publicae quaestionis, cum eius consilii iudex non esset,
et in eo consilio, cum causam non audisset et potestas esset
ampliandi, dixisse sibi liquere3 cum de incognita re iudicare
voluisset, maluisse condemnare quam absolvere: cum, si
uno minus damnaret, condemnari reus non posset, non ad
cognoscendam causam, sed ad explendam damnationem
praesto fuisse?' That is, a single vote turned the scale
against Oppianicus, and that vote was Falcula's. Thirty-
twojurors had to vote (ἓ 74); the passage quoted imports
that the division was 17 to 15 3 an even division (16 to 16)
would have been held a verdict, if not for the defendant, at
least in his favour. An adjournment would have ensued.
(Cp. the words of§ 74.)

Prof. Ramsay says—The vote stood as follows: nine jurors
of unimpeachable character gave a verdict of Guilty (here
follow the names, which occur in ἕ 107, P. Octavius Balbus,
etc.). Eiglzt jurorS, suspected of being venal, also gave a ·
verdict of Guilty, viz„ Staienus, Bulbus, Gutta, P. Popilius,
Fidiculanius Falcula, Aquilius, Septimius Scaevola, Egnatius.
