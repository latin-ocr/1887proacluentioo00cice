equivalent to statuere, the simple inf„ though the sense is sometimes
scarcely distinguishable from that of the last construction. Liv. ii. 18.
11, si, quod inpensae factum in bellurn erat, praestare Sabini in animum
induxissent. 8. bona eius omnia ad matrem esse ventura: the
property of an intestate‚ failing ‘sui heredes ⁷ (or children of his own),
passed to his consanguinei, i.e. brothers and sisters by the same father.
Sassia, if she married Cluentius pater with conventio in manum, would
rank (in law) as his daughter, and sister of Cluentius filius. Thus Ramsay
explains Cicero’s words. But it will be objected: what had become of
Cluentia, the sister of Cluentius? and had not Sassia passed out of the
manus of Cluentius when she married Oppianicus? The word bona.
points to the mother’s claims being under the praetor's edict to the
bonorum possessio, i.e. to the practical enjoyment, as opposed to the
strict technical heirship (hereditas). As Cluentius had no children and
no father, the mother would, if he died intestate‚ be entitled to the bon.
poss„ if there were no brother or sister. We hear of no brother; the
sister must be either dead or had ceased to belong to the Cluentian family
by marrying cum conventione in manum (Gai. i. ἐξ 109, 162, 163, etc.).
The mother, if she married Cluentius and passed into his manus, would
have had claim to the hereditas and to the bon. poss„ as if she had been a
daughter ; but she had married twice since, and had probably ceased to be-
long to the Cluentian family. She could thus claim only bonorum possessio,
not hereditas (succession by civil law). Cp. ἓ 165, where the language is
more explicit. [For this explanation I am indebted to Mr. Roby.]
9. aucta, as Class. says, is Nom. case, answering to orbata. So Verr.
ii. 5. 80, hac tanta praeda auctus. 10. necaretur3 the Subj. may
be somewhat difficult. (a) A good parallel is de Or. i. ἓ 167, alter plus
lege agendo petebat, quam' quantum lex in xii tabulis permiserat, quod
cum impetrasset, causa caderet: ‘having obtained which, he would, or
was to, be cast on the technical point.' So here, ‘so (he thought) she
might be, or would be, more easily killed,' or ‘intending to kill her more
easily.’ ‘The imperfects express the future force of the subj. in past ις
time.'—H. N. (b) We may however call the subj. simply hypothetical, f
i.e. apodosis with protasis aucta pecunia, orbata. filio: ‘who would,
if made richer, have furnished better reward for her death, and if deprived
of her son, have been killed with less risk ' : R. ξ 1534, r. 642. One might
have expected, instead of quae . . . necaretur, quam necari posse, so that
this would have been dependent on intellegebat. But Cic. has chosen
to put it independently [H. J. R.]. This Imperf. Subj. in past
time answers to the Pres. Subj. in present time—giving an assumption
possible at the time of its making, but falling in the province of things
past: the case is regarded as simply imaginary (not as unfulfilled).—
An ex. in R. 1532 c. (the seventh) brings this out well: Tusc. i. ξ 90,
Cur igitur et Camillus doleret, si haec . . . eventura putaret, et ego
doleam, si . . . gentem aliquam urbe nostra potituram putem? The forms
