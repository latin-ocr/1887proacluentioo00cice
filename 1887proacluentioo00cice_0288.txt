224 CRITICAL NOTES. [V. 13

modo, T. 21. cupiditate z civitate, S pr. m. continebat, ST;
continebatur, R. (A middle voice: cp. R. 1417. 1, r. 566. 1.) Baiter
suggests se continebat, referring to leg. agr. ii. ἓ 97, Parad. iii. ἓ 21.

23. non pudicitia, om. ST: so Kayser, and Baiter brackets. ‘ Propter ’

similitudinem praecedentium verborum (non pudor), facile excidere
potuerunt, et ad sensum satis ab iis differunt,' Cl.

13.--26. his, S. 30. se sine scelere, ST; sine scelere se, R.

14.—Page 6, l. 4. laetitia, ST; laetitia ac, R. 5. libidinis diutius,
ST; libidinis, Itaque diutiuS, R, followed by Class.‚ Ry., Kl.‚ and
Miill. (incl. itaque). Baiter connects the words victrix . . . libidinis
with the following sentence, omitting itaque ; so also Kayser, but
bracketing non libidinis. 10. Pluygers would excise omnium, which
Graevius had already done on the authority of two codd. But Quint. iv,
2. 121 quotes the passage as we have it; and there is a manifest anti-
thesis between omnz'um and nullis.

VI. 15.—-13. nonne, STF and Quint. iv. 2. 105 (best MSS.); non me, M ;
non a few inferior Mss. timuisti, ST and some inferior MSS„ and this
is Classen's reading3 timuisse, R, supported by Quint. l.c. and quoted
by Donatus on Ter. Phorm. ii. 1. 2. 15. cubiculi: cubilis, Τ.

16.—-19. dedecus, ST, and Class„ Bait. ; dedecus iam, Rand Ry.,
who defends iam as expressing that ‘ the disgrace was no longer confined
to Sassia individually, but now extended to the whole family' 3 the order
of the words is against this. No doubt, as Class. suggests, iam is due to
the following syllable fam. 20. modestia, T. 22. esse, STb (corr.) ;
om. R. 23. matre, om. ST. But there is a rhetorical precision in the
reiteration of the word, matris . . . matre : cp. infr. ἓ 17, hominum . . .
hominum. ne quae is a conjecture of Garatoni: ST reading nam-
que, from which Class. conjectures nam quae ε R giving ne quam, which
Ry. adopts. But probare suo iudicio with a personal object is a curious
expression, and quae . . . poterat comes in naturally to explain tantis
iniuriis ac tanto scelere. Most edd. have adopted ne quae. 24. ne
ea, T, indirectly supporting Garatoni’s emendation. 2 5. verum, ST;
sed, R.

17.—29. in, om. ST: but cp. §4‚ l. 12, quasi in aliqua . . . flamma
atque z'n . . . incendio, and ἓ 3, l. 5, explan. n. 32. qui (STFM cod.
Lamb.) ad hominum pericula. defendenda adiungerer (ST b corr.) : so
Class., Bait., Kays., Ry. Most MSS. and older edd. read quum ad
amici pericula depellenda adhiberer. We are indebted to ST for the

recovery of the true text: which is supported by ἓ 51, si . . . hominum ’

periculis non defuissem ; ἓ 157, ut omnis mihi cura et opera posita sit in

hominum periculis defendendis. Cicero says that he, professionally ¹
conversant as he is with the natural feelings of humanity‚ is the last man '3
in the world to ignore the natural sentiment, that the case of a son against

his own mother should not be pressed. But if we read quum . . . amici,
the argument tells the wrong way: ‘on an occasion on which Ι am
