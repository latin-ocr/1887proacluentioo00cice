148 . EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XXXIV. 94

ἓ 66. ⁴ We hear of a Tribunal Aurelium in Sest. ἓ 34, servorum delectus,
habebatur pro Tribunali Aurelio: and the Gradus Aurelii are supposed
to have been a flight of steps leading up to the elevated platform of the
Tribunal. It has been conjectured from the expression tum novi that
the whole structure was the work of M. Aurelius Cotta, consul with L.
Licinius Lucullus in 74 aest-Ry. 7. theatro, perhaps suggested by
the word gradus, which sometimes denotes the tiers of scats in a theatre
or amphitheatre. 9. ab reo ε cp. ξ 9, a Cluentio, with n.

peculatu, ἓ 147. 11. locus . . . non est, constitutus, τῖε. the Iudices
refused to place the cause upon the roll for trial (Ry.). It is evident from
this passage and ἓξ 56, 59 that the iudices of any quaestio could take the
cases which were to be tried in what order they pleased, and could also
(as an English Grand Jury) refuse to entertain a charge. Also from the
Dz'v. in Caec. we know that such a jury (unsworn) had sometimes to de-
cide between two claimants for the office of accuser. (V. Ry.’s note.)
L. Cornelius Sulla Faustus was the son of the dictator, to whom his
colossal fortune (supposed to have been acquired by the appropriation of
public moneys) had passed. Among the personal attacks which attended
the democratic reaction from the Sullan constitution (dating from B.C. 70
-the restoration of the tribunician power in its entirety), those made on
Faustus Sulla were the most persistent. V. Momms. iv, 2, pp. 160, 161 ;
Ry. on this passage. So leg. agr. i. ἓ 12 (spoken B.C. 63) of the golden
dreams of the agrarian commissioners ι ‘ maximam pecuniam se a Fausto
ablaturos arbitrantur: quam causam suscipere iurati iudices noluerunt„
hanc isti decemviri suscepere.’ Such an action had been unsuccessfully
brought against Sulla in the year of this speech. Cicero was adverse to it :
fr. of pro cornel. i. quam ego causam [de Sullae bonis] . . . praetor in
contione defendi, cum id dicerem quod eidem iudices postea statuerunt,
iudicium aequiore tempore fieri oportere. 1 1. de pecuniis residuis=ut
pecuniae publicae, quae residuae apud quemque essent, exigerentur (Ascon.
on Cornel. i. l.c.). Such charges were originally preferred under the
statute de peculatu. But in the last century of the Republic a distinction
was drawn between misappropriation of public money (pecuniam avertere,
in rem suam vertere), and neglect to disburse for the public service all the
money assigned. Pecuniae residuae is that which is over (residet) and is
not expended for the state: lege Julia de residuis tenetur qui pecuniam
publicam delegatam in usum aliquem retinuit neque in eum consumpsit
(Digest, xlviii. 13. l. 2). The action was in our case to recover arrears
of public money left in the hands of Sulla. V. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 308.
12. exlegem, ‘ above the law,’ lege solutum as opposed to legibus teneri:

the word means ready to ‘defy the 1aw.' 13. contemptam atque
