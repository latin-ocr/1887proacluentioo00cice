EXORDIUM, ἐξ 1—8.

Ι. 1.-—Page 1, l. 1. omnem,i.q. totam. Cp. Sest. ξ 53, illud quod mihi in
hac omni est oratione propositum; Caes„ Gallia est omnis divisa in partes
tres,with Verr. 11. i. ἓ 34, haec eadem erit quadripartita distributio totius ac-
cusationis meae. It may be omitted in translating. The Exordium (ἐξ 1-8)
opens with the ‘ Partitio' of the subject into ‘invidia’ or prejudice‚ and
‘crimina' or substantive charges. This contrast runs through the first
three sections, being no less than six times renewed, but so skilfully varied
as to secure the maximum of repetition with the minimum of tediousness.
In ἓ 1 the order is invidia )( crimina ε in ἐξ 2, 3, crimina )( invidia:
then declining on to invidia, Cicero gives the keynote of the first and
main part of his argument (ἓξ 9-142) at the end of the section. 2. altera
is in both places abl. case, the subject to videbatur being accusator.
When there is a choice, Latin generally prefers a personal to an imper-
sonal subject for a verb of action. 3. iam : after the lapse of eight years ;
v. Introd. invidia iud. Iun. : the Latin genitive is used with much
pregnancy of meaning, especially by Cicero, being applied to every kind of
relation ; in this passage, to that of cause and ffel. This use connects
alike with the possessive and the objective uses. It may be classed as a
genitive of the remoter object, answering to a prepositional phrase such as
ob iudicium. Cp. Mur. ἓ 56, odio inimicitiarum; Scaur. ἓ 11, discessus
solitudo3 Verg. A. ii. 413, ereptae virginis ira, ‘originating in,' ‘entailed
by’; 5171, perfugium calamitatis, ‘refuge from missortune.' R. 1318,
