IV. 9] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 87

 

31. Statium Albium Oppianicum. Cp. ξ 65. 33. This is a good

ἐξ example of what the rhetoricians called partitio: and as such it is
’ἢ quoted by Quintilian (iv. 5. 11), who says that some criticised this
ζῖ division on the ground that it would have been enough for Cicero to
γ establish· his third point (iudicium illud pecunia esse temptatum . . .
ξ’ εοῐιῒῐαᾬωεηῖίυῐη) without proving the two former points. But the truth

is that the third point is established by the help of the former two.
32. atrocitatis, ‘virulence.' Atrox (connected with ater as celox with Q*
celer) must have meant originally, ‘dull leaden black' (a fast colour);

. cp. atra tempestaS, ater Cocytos: nzssger meaning ‘glossy black.' In
many of its applications the idea of persz'stence is prominent, ag. Plaut.
Capt. 534 (Ussing), nisi reperio atrocem mihi aliquam astutiam, of
defiantly ‘brazening it out' [‘some double-dyed contrivance,’ comically
serious.-H. N.]: Hor. C. ii. 1. 24, praeter atrocem animum Catonis,
of inflexible resolution: (we may compare the Platonic ἀνδρεία,
which is compared to the fast colours of the dyer, δευσοποιὸν γίγνεται τὸ
βαφέν, as being a conservation of imbibed opinions about danger, Rep.
429 Ez) Verg. A. i. 662, urit atrox Iuno, equivalent to the ‘memor
Iunonis ira ’ of i. 4, in which atrox signifies ‘ relentless hatred.' And this
is the sense of atrocitas here. 33. innocentem pecunia circumventum,
‘this charge of compassing the ruin of an innocent man by bribery.'-— P.
Cp. the title of one of C. Gracchus' laws, ne quis iudicio circumveniatur.
Pago 4, l. 1. maioribus criminibuS, v. n. on §4, 1. 10. An abl. of
attendant circumstances: cp. Brut. ξ 164, nulla est altercatio clamoribus
umquam habita maioribus: ‘on more'heinous charges, or charges better
attested.' 2. praeiudicia: ‘previous judgments’ ; ‘judgments which
form precedents) So Asconius on Dz‘vz‘n. ξ 12 explains the word—
praeiudicium dicitur res, quae cum statuta fuerit, adfert iudicaturis
exemplum quod sequantur. The meaning ‘ prejudice ’ is post-classical.
4. non modo (Q) ab isdem, sed ne ab aliis quidem. The negative
after non modo (non solum) may be omitted when there is a negative in the
latter member of the sentence, and also a predicate common to both
members, but expressed (with the negative) in the latter of the two only.
Cp. 589, non modo causae, sed ne legi quidem quicquam . . . -laxamenti
datum est: ἓ 178. Liv. i. 40, advenam non modo vicinae sed ne Italicae
quidem stirpis (=qui non modo . . . stirpis esset). The force of the
expressed negative extends to the former member of the sentence. R.
2240 e., r. 881 c. ; Madv. 461 b., with obs. 1. 7. ‘Not on the side
of Cluentius but against Cluentius’: so Mr. Nettleship would render
a Cluentio, comparing Lucr. i. 693, nam contra sensus ab sensibus ipse
repugnat, with Munro's note. A similar use of the preposition occurs in
ξ 93 ad fin.‚ ‘non modo dicendi ab reo . . .' Peterson. Cp. also
Rosc. Am. ξ 85, praeest huic quaestioni vir et contra audaciam fortissimus
et ab innocentia clementissimus. This use of ab with contra seems technical‚
ag. in the rhetorical treatise of Cornificius (auct. ad Heremz.) ii. ξ 12,
