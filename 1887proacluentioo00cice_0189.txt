tum). (V. Ry. Rom. Ant. pp. 292, 293.) We seem to have an allusion
to the three orders in ad Att. i. 16. 3, maculosi senatores, nudi equites,
tribuni non tam aerarii, ut appellantur, quam aerati, ‘Senators under a
stigma, destitute knights, paymasters who should rather be called pay-
takers’ (adopting Prof. Tyrrell's reading). invidia: the crisis which
preceded the passing of the lex Aurelia is described thus, Verr. i.
ἓ 2, nunc in ipso discrimine ordinis iudiciorumque vestrorum cum sint
parati qui contionibus et legibus hanc invidiam senatus inflammare conentur,
cet. The agitation of the tribune Quinctius after the ‘iudicium Iunianum '
(ἐξ 79, 93) is mainly meant. 17. The following passage is an example
of an altercatio, which is opposed by the rhetoricians to perpetua oratio.
18. responderent, n. on rescinderent, l. 8. Perhaps, however, it is better
to treat the subj. as hypothetical. The imperf. is preferred to the
pluperf„ because the condition is one possible at the time of its making,
but falling in the province of things past. Cp. necaretur, ἓ 45, l. 10, with
note;§ 105, l. 12, n. si qui: cp. n. on ἓ 7, si qui deus. We
should expect si quis. 19. quod. . . . voluisset, v, crit. n. It is
suboblz‘que: that is, an oblique dependent clause cropping up in Or. Recta.
It is a reported reason3 the reason which they themselves entertained at
a previous time (that of the condemnation) and report now in terms
applicable to the reason of anotlzer person. ‘We did it, on the ground
that he had desired‚' etc. Cp. R. 1744 (with ex. from Hor. Ep. i. 10.
49), r. 740. 2. [Ι should take the words nempe . . . voluisset as Cicero’s,
not as the jurors' answer. ‘ No doubt you will say you did it, because in
your opinion he had wished.' Quod . . . voluerat would be a reason
now given for their former action: (as in ἓ 55, quod dicebat :) possibly
quite a different reason from that on which they formerly acted—H. J. R.]
21. consequebatur: mark the tense. ‘What was he likely to gain?'
25. probabatur : cp. ἓ 101, nummarius interpres pacis et concordiae non
probabatur; where the verb, personally used, has the same sense: for
which v, Gloss. 27. inconstantiam, ‘inconsistency’-sc. sibi non
constabant res iudicatae: libidinem, ‘caprice,' is always used in a bad
sense. It signifies ‘unregulated desire' as opposed to voluntas, and even
cupido: so libet ‘it is my fancy,' but volo ‘ I will,’ cupio, ‘ I wish,' placet,
‘it is my resolve.’ Quilibet, any one taken at random: quivis, any one
you please.
