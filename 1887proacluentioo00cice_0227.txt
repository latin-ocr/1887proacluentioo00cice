XLI. 115] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 163

of guilty has been pronounced. Personal considerations—the fear of
making an enemy—will enter into the problem‚ and the jury will refuse
to admit a capital charge against the man whom they have condemned 3
or, perhaps, having cleared their consciences by the verdict, they will be
less careful how they make their assessment. Because they are thus lenient
or careless or both (itaque) it will happen that a criminal is rendered liable
to a fresh charge (such as maiestas) by the terms of the lit. aest„ but acquitted
when brought to his trial on it : or, again, a third party is implicated in the
lit. aest. as the recipient of money embezzled, and acquitted when sepa-
rately tried. Such a conflict of sentences is no upsetting of legal
decision33 it is simply an assertion of the principle that a litis
aestimatio is not the same thing as a iudicium.’ 7. litem 00
nomine esse aestimatam: the following passage does not give us
a very full explanation of the litis aestimatio, nor, as Cicero pro-
fesses to be addressing experts, can we expect it, and there is no reason
(with Ry.) to suspect the text. In cases of repetundae or peculatus the
litis 1108111111,1111310μ was as distinct from the iudicium or verdict of guilty or
not guilty as is the verdict of the jury from the sentence of the judge with
us. It was (according to Rab. Post. ἓ 8) quasi appendicula causae iudi-
catae atque damnatae. (i.) It was the process by which, in the case of
certain offences in which the punishment admitted of as many degrees as
the offence, all the details of the penalty were adjusted: on what 50010
(quo nomine) compensation was to be made, to what persons, in what
amount. (ii.) Besides this specification of the degree of the offence, a
different complexion might be given to the offence in the course of the
investigation. ‘ The l. aest. was not a mere assessment of damages, but
might also contain a statement that the accused was guilty of an offence
which should be tried under another quaestio.' Pseudo-Ascon. on Verr-
i. 39, litis aestimationem fieri non solum ex titulo propositi criminis sed
etiam ex aliis probationibus quae ex ante actis rebus apud iudices con·
stiterint (quoted by Prof. Nettleship in Ρ.). (111.) More than this, other
persons might be incriminated‚ and might be called up to defend them-
selves against the imputa'tion made upon them. These three points are
illustrated in the· text, § 116, lines 4-8‚ 8-10, 10—13. As there was
nothing repugnant to Roman notions of justice in the idea of taking
other offences into account, besides that charged, in convicting a man,
so it was also in sentencing him (though here English practice accords).
And as the litis aestimatio might lead to a trial and condemnation
on another charge (notified in the assessment upon the original charge)
he might presumably suffer twice for the same offence. [It will be
well to collect the main references to litis aestimatio upon which
the above statement is based :—(i.) Pseudo-Ascon. Verr. i. § 38, hoe est
pecunia de qualis fuit, et propter quam condemnatus est, in summam
redacta, quae de eius rebus exigeretur: ‘ This denotes the money, on
account of which the case was tried and the defendant convicted, brought
