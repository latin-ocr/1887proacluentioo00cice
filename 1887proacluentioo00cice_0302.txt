238 CRITICAL NOTES. [XXIV. 65

¹65.—10. Staieno in ST henceforward. Cp. ⁴1¹· on ξ 20, 1. 3.
14. negate, ST, Class., Bait., Kays. ; negato negate, R, and so Ry. ; ‘Ad
fulciendam eiusdem verbi repetitionem, apponi solet z'nquam,’ Class.,
quoting ἓ 62, nihil nihil inquam3 Flacc. ἓ 3, hoc ternpore hoc inquam
tempore, and other exx. We may add Cluent. ἓ 12, mater . . . mater
inquam appellabitur ; ξ 125, dum vero eum fuisse Oppianicum constabit
. . . dum haec inquam· constabunt, ἓ 168. But there are also cases in
which the same idea repeated in a slightly different form is introduced
by inquam: e.g. Verr. ii. 4. 7, haec omnia . . . abstulit: nullum,
inquam, horum reliquit. So here audete negare is taken up by negate.
16. meo, STF and others, Bait., Kays., Klotz 3 111 eo, R, Class., and Ry.
We must compare Rosa. Am. ξ 73, ita quaero abs te, C. Eruci, quo modo,
et sic tecum agam, ut in eo loco (so all the MSS„ Madv, corr. meo loco)
vel respondendi vel interpellandi tibi potestatem faciam, vel etiam, si
quid voles, interrogandi. In eo loco would mean (as Manutius says) ‘in
subselliis accusatorum’: contrast hoc ipso in loco, ἕ 54, i.e. ‘in sub-
selliis reorum,’ and compare § 168, ex illo loco. We should certainly
expect here andin Rosc. Am. l.c. illo, not eo (Lambinus conj. isto). It
is therefore better, with the best MSS. and Madvig (opusc. Acad. i. p. 122),
who quotes the present passage, to adopt the reading meo. The change Ι
in the MSS. from MEO to INEO would be a very slight one. an, ST;
at, R. 19. datam post iudicium, om. ST.

66.-24. ut item, ST; item, R. 25. quod: quo, ST, an. error.
30. se, STF3 om. M, Class., Ry. 31. donis datis muneribusque:
so all MSS. , but ST, which read datis muneribUS, and are followed by
Class., Ry., Bait., Kays.; Miill. brackets donis and -que. Class.
supposes that the former reading is due to the mistake of a scribe who,
taking datis for a subst., glossed it with donis. But there are limits to
the stupidity of scribes, though not, perhaps, to that of the editors who
punctuated thus—donis, datis, muneribusque, because Cicero should

otherwise have written donis muneribusque datis. It is more likely that .

a scribe, unfamiliar with the phrase dona et munera, corrected to datis
muneribus: muneribus alone would have been better, ordonis muneri-
busque3 cp. ἓ 19o,accusatorem . . . donis muneribusque . . . obstrinxit.
Dona et munera, donum munus, were legal phrases: ag. there was a
law of L. Cincius de donis et muneribus (de Orat. ii. ἓ 286). Ulpian
distinguishes donum from munus, as genus from species. 32. fautore,
ST b (corn), cod. S. Vict.; auctore, R. The latter is explained as
defensor: Staienus, who should have acted as iudex, acted as patronus,
acted partially. But this will scarcely hold.

67.-1-33. erat, ST; esset, R. Pago 26, 1. 1. sententia. absolu-
tus : these words are probably an interpolation. Gar. did not find them
in his Ms. 3 Kays. brackets. absolutus . . . sententia, om. M.

XXV.—8. non, omitted by all good MSS. except ST (and a Palatine Ms.‘,
according to Gruter). Graevius says that both MSS. F rancii omit it, and
