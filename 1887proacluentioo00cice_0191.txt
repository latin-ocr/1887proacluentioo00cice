xxw. 65] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 127

Thus R. 1530 e, r. 638 c ; Bradley’s Arn. ἓ456.1 22. veri similius . . .
oum potius corrupisse: a pleonastic doubling of the comparative. So
Pis. ἓ 14, mihi quaevis fuga potius quam ulla provincia esset optatior. So
too we have potius malle, magis malle, rursus revocari. 26. alia ra-
tione, alia quacunque ratione, sc. nisi iudices corrumperet, ‘upon any
other supposition‚' ‘in any other case.’ V. L. and Short sub. voc. alius,
I. A. sub. fin„ for this use. 28. offendisset, ‘had been unsuccessful.’
Cp. offensionis, ξ 10 n.

64.--3o. immicuS, v. erit. n. 32. Cic. here with the na‘i've dogma-
tism of an advocate proceeds to base his main argument on'a logical
sallacy. The dilemma propounded can be eluded by a third hypo·
thesis—that in fact both parties bribed. And this has the sanction of
a previous utterance of Cicero himself: Verr. i. ἓξ 38, 39, cognoscet
ex me populus Romanus, quid sit . . . quod inventus sit senator, qui cum
iudex esset, in eodem iudicio et ab reo pecuniam acciperet quarn iudicibus
divideret et ab accusatore ut reum condemnaret. (Quint. v. 10. 68, quotes
the argument with approval.) ’

XXIV. 65.‘—Page 25, 1. 11. Statium Albium Oppianicum. Nomen
and cognomen seem to be used almost indifferently in designating a person.
So Cluentius is constantly called Habitus. Cp. ἓ 9 init. ; there the words
of the indictment against Cluentius seem to be quoted (cp. n. on quo):
here Cicero frames his own indictment as a retort, and it seems as
though ‘ Statius Albius ' were a more formal designation than ‘Oppianicus.’
15. negate, inquam, meo loco, ‘ deny it, I say, though you should
interrupt me in order to make the denial.' Cp. crit. n.: meo loco is the
Greek ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ ὕδατι (an expression derived from the use in court of the
clepsydra or water—clock). Whichever reading we adopt, it is implied
that the counsel for the defence might not be interrupted in the course of
his speech by the prosecution, except upon his own challenge. 16. an
introduces the second alternative in a disjunctive question (cp. n. on
ἓ 99, l. 8). Here the first alternative is not (as sometimes happens)
suppressed: rather, it is contained in quid tacetis? ‘Why are you
silent? am I right in saying silent? or is it the case that you must speak
in despite of yourselves?' An almost=nonne: cp. a similar sentence
in ἓ 181, where however anznum. 17. repetistis, sc. a Staieno,
from whom the bribe-money was recovered by legal action, ξ 78.
18. ‘ How then have you the faceto speak of bribery?' From its use
in this connection, os comes to mean ‘effrontery ’—-or‚ to give the nearest
equivalent in the language, ‘ cheek.’ So Ov. T rist. i. 1. 113—

hos tu vel fugias vel si satis orz's habebis
Oedipodas facito Telegonosque voces.

So in Greek ποίοις ὄμμασι; Soph. O. T. 1371.

1 A different view of (a) is to be found in Madv. 347, b. 2 (Eng. trans.), but this is
not so in his third German edition.
