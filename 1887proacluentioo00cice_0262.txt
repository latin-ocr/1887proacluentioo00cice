165.-7. Vibium cappadocem: v. crit. n. on the name. 11. Many
books insert after mortuus, ‘ At heres est Cluentius ’ z v. crit. n.
13. huic, uuus sororis fillo . . . Num. Cluentio, ‘ Num. Cluentius, whom
you see in court, son of my client’s sister.’ Illius can only refer to Cluen-
tius, the defendant ; the pronoun hz‘c (which is more usual for him) being
bespoken already. Ry. at the end of his note implies that illius: Vibi,
as does P. in his translation (though not in his note). This is certainly
wrong: we should have had eius, or no pron. at all, had Num. Cluentius
been nephew of Vibius. It remains to inquire who this sister of Cluen-
tius and her son were. (1) She is not the daughter of Sassia by A.
Aurius Melinus, for that daughter married Oppianicus minor (ἓ 179), and
therefore could not have had a son called Num. Cluentius. (2) Was she
a daughter of Sassia by Oppianicus maior? No such daughter is men-
tioned z and the name again forbids it. (3) Probably this sister is Cluen-
tius’s own sister Cluentia, who was two years married to A. Aurius
Melinus (§ 14), and may have borne him this son. Why then is the son
not called Aurius, like L. Aurius (ἓ 2 5)? One reason may be suggested.
His mother may have been divorced before his birth from A. Aurius
Melinus. So he took his mother’s nomen, and the praenomen of the sons
of Dinaea, his father’s kinswoman, an uncommon one, as we see from Sest. a
ξ 82, where one Numerius Quinctius Rufus escapes the hue and cry
‘ gemini nominis errore‚’ Numerius being known to some people only as a
praenomen, to others only as a nomen. On his father’s side he must have
been connected with Vibius. It is noticeable that such a son ranks as
an eques.

13. ex edicto praetoris: the succession to the property of an in-
* testate was originally determined by the laws of the Twelve Tables 3 modi-
fications, however, were introduced by various Praetorian Edicts. Ry. R.
Ant. p. 264. [The edictum perpetuum of the praetor was a manifesto
published upon his entry upon office, stating the legal principles upon
which he proposed to base his official action. A new praetor naturally
adopted in its main features the edict of the outgoing praetor, adding per-
haps something of his own. Thus by this ‘ quasi-legislation ' of succes-
sive praetors the edictum perpetuum (‘standing edict ⁹) or translaticium
(‘transmitted') grew into a codified manual of civil law, the Edict of
Julianus in Hadrian’s reign forming its culmination. V. Momms. R.
St. i. 197, ii. 212, 213. Also Maine's Ancient Law, p. 63.] V. n. on
