not expressed an opinion either one way or the other. 18. quod erat
libertini rmus: from the time of Appius Claudius the censor (B.c. 312)
the grandsons of freedmen ceased to be ineligible for office and for a seat
in the senate ; not so the sons of freedmen. (Thus in the Fasti the names
of a magistrate's father and granaJatlzer are all but invariably given, ag.
L. Cornelius Gn. f. Gn. n. Scipio ε a slave-grandfather could not be
named). Cp. Hor. Serm. i. 6. 20, censorque moveret Ι Appius, ingenuo
si non essem patre natus. But the old predilection for one whose family
was freeborn sor at least two generations back still remained. (This is
Mommsen's view, after Suetonius : most supposed that Appius admitted
freedmen's sons: ν. Rb'm. Staatsr. i.2 459, 460.) 19. locum quidem
. . liberat. This is an early instance of the bestowal of those orna-
menta (‘ insignia of fictitious’ or titulat ‘magistracy,’ as Momms. calls
them), which generally, like the ornamenta triumphalia, gave much more
of the show of power than of its substance, and were therefore in later times
a frequent mark of imperial favour. They answered variously to different
magistracy‚ being quaestoria (as probably in this case), praetoria, etc.‚ as
the case might be. If a man was a senator, the bestowal of ornamenta
quaestoria, praetoria, etc.‚ would entitle him to take his place among the
quaestorz'z', praetorii, etc.‚ in the senate3 they did not, however, count for
the realities (quaestorship, etc.), in the gradus honorum, or scale of official
promotion. If a man was not a senator, they did not confer a seat in the
senate : what they did give him was a certain style and certain insignia.
At public festivals he might sit among the senators, he shared their
banquets, he wore their garb. In the present instance we find them
bestowed on Popilius as a consolation for more substantial honours lost by
no fault of his own. V. Momms. R. St. i.2 440-446, and Gloss. ornamcn· ‚

prep. inis used: the sense is, ‘to take up one’s position on something,’
i.e. ‘ stand to,' ‘affirm it.’ V. R. 1172, r. 488. This idiom must not be
confounded with stare ab aliquo, ‘to stand by,' ‘ on the side of, some one.’
