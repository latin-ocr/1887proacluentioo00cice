stances the famous quarrel of M. Livius Salinator and C. Claudius Nero,
censors in B.C. 204, who marked and degraded each other. Mommsen
emphasises the exceptional sanction required for the censorial nota :
whereas generally each member of an official collegium is invested with
the whole of the powers of that collegium unless a collega interposes a veto,
in this matter the positive co-operation of the collega is necessary : his mere
acquiescence is not enough : the nota must represent the two censors acting
in concert. In contrast with a discors censura such as this passage de-
scribes, ep. Liv. xlv. 15. 8, omnes eidem ab utroque et tribu moti et aerarii
facti, neque ullius, quern alter notaret, ab altero levata ignominia. V. Ry.

alter . . . vetet: the censor by his nola either movet senatu, or equum
adimit (cp. ξ 134 infr.), or tribu movet. Now, as to the third of these, we
must distinguish between the operation of the censor's action in an earlier
and in a later period. The transition from the former to the latter is
marked by the censorship of Appius Claudius Caecus‚,13.c. 312, who allowed
landless citizens and freedmen to be enrolled in the tribes z supplementing
this reform, in B.C. 304, the censor C. Fabius Rullianus confined landless
citizens to the four city tribes ; the same was afterwards done with freed-
men. In the former of these periods we have tribules paying a tribulum
on landed property, and, opposite to them, aerarii taxed on personal- pro· ’
perty. The latter have no ius suffragii, and in consequence no ius
honorum: their only political privilege is to pay taxes. (A third class
consisted of the capite censi, who had no property to show, and therefore
could not be taxed.) In the latter period the tributum was raised on
property of all kinds, landed or personal: citizenship, not landed owner·
ship, was the qualification for membership in a tribus. Thus the dis-
tinction between tribules and 'aerarii (using the words in their olcl sense)
disappears. A new distinction appears instead. There is now a higher
class, who pay taxes on their land 3 and a lower class, who are taxed
on their personalty. The former constitute the country tribes, the latter
