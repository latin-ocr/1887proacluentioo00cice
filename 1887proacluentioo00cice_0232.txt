120.—-23. Nunc, νῦν δε, ‘but as it is': generally in connection with
an unfulfilled supposition (preceding it as a rule): as in ὅ 139,
nemo adhiberet oratorem. Nunc adhibemur . . .;§ 171,§ 80, itaque
nunc quem admodum audiar, sentio . . . at tum si dicerem non
audirer z ‘ But the fact is, that a freedman . . . may procure the convic-
tion of some man sor theft, and he will lose every privilege of rank, and
never recover a shred of his respectability : but those whom Gellius and
Lentulus themselves . . . stigmatised, have not merely returned to the
senate but have actually been acquitted after formal trial on the charges
brought against them.' 24. On tlzeft as a subject of iudicium privatum
in Roman law v. Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 275. 25. ornamentis: v, Gloss.
28. captarum [ob rem iudicandam]pecun1arum‚ cp. ξ 103. 1101111110, ‘ on
account os’ ε referring to the subscriptio, or statement of the reason for
affixing the stigma. Cp. the use of nomen in accounts: ξ 99, quae
cum accepisset nomine iudicii Safiniani, with n. notaverunt, n. on
ξ 117, 1. 22.

XL111.-31. non modo (non) . . . sed ne . . . quidem, as in ξ 9,
1. 4, ubi v. n. Cp. also ἓ 89, l. 30. Here the negative is repeated
(neminem . . . non) : v, R. 2246 a, 1. 884 a. 33. iudicem, ‘ arbitrator,’
v. ξ 74, 1. 29 n. Pago 46, l. 1. ⁴ In all laws which specify disquali·
fications sor filling any public office, or being chosen juror or acting as
prosecutor, this, the stigma of the censors, nowhere appears.' Cp. what
was said above§ 119, 1. 15: also n. on in aerarios referri, ὅ 122, 1. 20.
For ignominiae, gen. of definition (‘ this cause, viz. ignominia ³) v. R. 1302,
r. 523 a. 2. capere is here ‘to take an office upon one's-self.’ It is
conversely used, meaning ‘to elect,' generally of the Flamen Dialis,
Pontifices, augurs, Vestal virgins. 3. lego, in senatum aliquem ἓ 132,
scribam ξ 126, is a general term : creo, facio, and dico are used of all State
appointments; prodo, properly to publislz an appointment; opto ‘to
choose,’ an old-fashioned word, whence cooptatio, the election by a collegium
(of priests) to a vacancy in its body.

121.—8. There was no provocatio ad populum, ‘appeal to the people,'
against the censor's subscriptio: ser the very reason that, as Cic. argues, it
was not a iudicium. But the people could reverse the censor’s action,
say by electing the notatus to a magistracy (which would restore him his
seat in the Senate‚ cp. n. on ἓ 119, 1. 15), or by a popular vote restoring
him to his previous status (just as an exile might by popular vote be
re-called). Cp. Momms. R. Staatsr. ii. 373 n. religio (εὐσέβεια,
Demosth.) is constantly associated with the juror's oath: cp. ἓ 107, l. 3,
and Ry. Rom. Ant. p. 297. V. Glossary. For dulgentia, ‘vigil-
ance,' cp. n. on ἓ 3. 12. qul iurati . . . referre: these words

ἱ seem to imply the existence at this time (after the law of Aurelius Cotta)
