‘the Saguntines had a missile called phalarica! Caes. B. G. vii. 55,
Noviodunum erat oppidum Aeduorum—‘Initium narrationis quidam
utique faciendum a persona putant . . . Hoc sane frequentissimum est,
quia personae sunt, inter quas iitigatur. Sed hae quoque interim cum
suis accidentibus ponendae, cum id profuturum est' (Quint. iv, 2. 129,
130, illustrating by this passage the rhetorical arrangement—first the
person, then the matter of suit). 2. municipii Larinatis. ‘ Larinum,
the ruins of which now bear the name of Larino vecchio, was situated
about twelve miles from the Upper Sea, on the right hand of the
Tifernus (Biserno)‚ which divided Apulia from the country of the Fren-
tani '—Ramsay, who refers to Pliny (ΖΙ. Ν. iii. 16), ‘ Larinates cognomine

Frentani ⁹ ; and Silius Italicus (xv. 565)—

, quaque iacet Superi Larinas accola Ponti,

qua duri bello gens Marrucina, fidemque
exuere indocilis sociis Frentanus in armis.

3. regionis et vicinitatis: the use of a duplicate phrase where in a
terser style a single word would have sufficed is characteristic of Cicero.
Cp. such phrases as ‘via atque ratio,’ method 3 labefacto et infirmo, I
z'7zvalz‘date3 invidia et offensio (ἓ 69); vehemens et gravis (ὅ 77). 3. no-
bilitas, ‘ noble birth‚' implies to a Roman something of what is con-
veyed to us by the idea of a ‘title ² or ‘ peerage ⁷: associated as it is with
the ius imaginum, possessed by a family which could number curule magis-
trates among its ancestors. Cp. Sall. sug. 85, quia imagines non habeo
et quia mihi nova nobilitas est (Marius is the speaker). [The original
idea is, that a man is known by having held office, eto—H. N.] JuV. Sat.
Vlll. 1 —
9 tota licet veteres exornent undique cerae
atria, nobilitas sola est atque unica virtus.

V. Glossary: and n. on p. 28, 1. 1, p. 42, l. 25. 4. L. Cornelius
Sulla and Q. Pompeius Rufus were consuls B.C. 88: which year marks
the outbreak of the First Mithradatic War, the invasion of Rome (held
by the Marians) by the army of Sulla, and the close of the Social War.
5. The younger Cluentius was therefore born B.C. 103. 8. tum,
‘at that time,' as opposed to his discreditable conduct afterwards.
inter suos et, honesto et nobili: suos and suo (l. 7), refer to different
subjects, an irregularity which is allowed where no ambiguity can arise:
here indeed the words are equivalent to qui adulescens . . . inter
suos honestus . . . erat, which is perfectly regular. R. 2265, r. 894.
inter implying ‘emz'nence among' is generally used with the Super-
lative Adj„ as an equivalent of the Partitive Genitive: Rosc. Am. ἓ 16,
ipse honestissimus inter suos numerabatur. For the Positive cp. Flacc.
ἕ 52, inter suos nobiles. [Honestus‚ ‘distinguished,' ‘reputable,’ Germ.
angeselcen.—H. N.]
