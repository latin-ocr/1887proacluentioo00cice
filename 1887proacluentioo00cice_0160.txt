96 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [VI. 18

[for est] defenderem. For the mood ν. R. 1714, r. 718. [The double use
of hominum, in this and the preceding line, is clearly purposed. No one
is a fit advocate in men’s dangers, who does not see what is part of men’s
nature—H. J. R.] ad hominum pericula defendenda : cp. the equiva-
lent expressions alicuius periculum depellere, amicorum pericula propulsare
(Sest. ἓ 2; Plzz'l. vii. ξ 7; Cluent. ἓ 144). V. crit. n. Page 7, 1. 2. A
kind of Aposiopesis—‘ quae vero nec ferri possunt nec taceri, eloquenda,’
or some such words, might supply it.

18.—5. conflatum et profectum : v. crit. n. sor the meaning.
6. ‘ Allow the veil of reticence‚ if not of oblivion‚ to cover them‚' P.
7. V. crit. n. 9. periculum (cp. hominum pericula above) refers,
as often elsewhere, to the particular danger of a criminal trial. Originally,
as a verbal subst. from *peri-ri ‘to try‚’ it denotes ‘trial,' and by im-
plication of failure ‘ danger.' Cp. Mr. Reid on Arclz. ξ 13: the
Eng. danger (Low Latin dangz‘arz'um from dominium, feudal authority)
was originally a legal term t Shakesp. Merclzant of Venice, 1V. i., ‘ you
stand within his danger.’ 11. adornata. . . . instruitur . . .
comparatur ε the same words are used in a somewhat different collocation
infra, ἓ 191, totius denique huius ab illa est et inventa et adornata com-
paratio criminis. Cp. also instituit accusatores instruit testes wsthg 192,
his rebus instructum accusatorem, conquirendorum testium causat and
some other correspondences. We can only distinguish the words
thus: comparo is to ‘provide' or ‘levy,' instruo and adorno to ‘ equip'
and ‘set on soot ' what has been provided (‘to place on a war-footing’)
(ep. Rosc. Am. ξ 30, testes in hunc et accusatores huiusce pecunia corn-
parant), instituo to ‘driu ’—cp. Phil. xi. §33, Deiotari regis . . . magnus
et nostro more institutus exercitus : a military term, as are the other three. ’
V. Mr. King on Phil. l.c. 15. The aecused appeared in court in mourn-
ing (sordidatus). So ἓ 192, where v, n. Such appeals to the feelings of the
jury were considered perfectly legitimate. V. Ramsay's note: also Heitland,
Cic. Mur. Appendix A, ‘ On the Spirit of Roman Trials.' exitium
exoptat: alliteration. 18. temere appellari, ‘that I do not know
what Ι arn doing in introducing her name into the case.' [Temere prop. ==
‘in the dark‚’ so here ‘ that my act is blind, reckless, wanton ' : metaphor
kept up in perspexeritis and aperta—H. N.] Same root in tenebrae.
A ppello always implies a personal address, anduis generally qualified by an
adverb or adverbial phrase, ag. comiter (Phil. xiii. ἓ 4) asperius (leg.
agr. ii. §63) and honoris causa passim: cp. also Catil. ii. ἓ 12, quis eum
senator appellavit? quis salutavit? quis denique . . . aspexit? To salute
by name was a special compliment, to attack by name an act of declared
hostility. 22. summatim, v. n. on strictim, ἓ 29.

of A. Cluentius and the motive of the prosecution ': cp. l. 29, quam con-
