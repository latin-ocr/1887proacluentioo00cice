the plot, Scamander and Fabricius. The first named was
defended by Cicero himself, who professes to have been out-

matched at all points by the other counsel, P. Cannutius : by

the side of the accused sat Oppianicus himself, who identified

Ψ himself completely with his case. The only vote recorded

for Scamander was that of the notorious Aelius Staienus. This
then was the first praeiudicium or ‘previous decision ² against
Oppianicus. Fabricius, who was next accused, was fain to

'betake himself for his defence to the brothers Caepasii. His

cause, desperate enough already, was made even worse by
his advocate: he was unanimously convicted. This was the
second praeiudicium.

Lastly, Cluentius impeached Oppianicus himself, before the

same jurors and presiding judge (C. Junius) as those who had
tried Scamander and Fabricius.l We now enter upon the
history of the famous ‘iudicium Iunianum,' which supplied
L. Quinctius and other agitators with a popular cry against
the senatorial juries, until these gave place, in B.C. 70, to
those constituted under the lex Aurelia.

§8 According to Cicero, Oppianicus, knowing the hope-
lessness of his position, had recourse once more to Staienus,
who had already sold him his vote at the trial of Scamander.
To him he handed a sum of 64o,ooo sesterces ( ,ζ 5440), which
was to be distributed among sixteen members of the bench,
whose voteS, together with his own, would make up the necessary ,
majority for acquittal. Staienus, when he had once got the
money, found himself very loath to part with it: a little
reflection convinced him that it would be unnecessary to do so
if he could procure the condemnation of Oppianicus. This
he set himself to do. By promising a bribe from the accused
to Bulbus, Gutta, and other jurors, and then disappointing
thern on the pretence that Oppianicus had played him false,
he made it certain that they would all follow his example and
vote to a man for a conviction: in this event he had good
hopes that there would be no one to reclaim the money.

As to the latter of Staienus' expectations, itnwas frustrated
in the same way as the poisoning plot in which Scamander
was employed: again there was a private interview, and
‘viri boni’ secreted behind the arras. By the help of their

³² · evidence Staienus was forced to disgorge (ξ 78). But the

conviction had followed in due course. Cannutius, the
