234 CRITICAL NOTES. [XVI. 48

it unnecessary to be precise in every mention of the story, or more likely
because he has his reasons for vague language, such as ‘ venenum diebus
paucis comparatur ’ (which does not tell us how the poison was bestowed).
As Mr. Peterson observes, there is another unexplained point ε Diogenes
had been solicited to administer the drug himself to Cluentius 3 why was
he selling it to Scamander?

48.—11. esse diceret, T, dicit esse, FM.

XVII.—16. manifesteque, ST; manifestoque, R; cp. ἓξ 40, 43,
however : the form in -e is not found elsewhere in Cic.

49.—22. venerit, ST. 26. unum, all good Mss. ; but Lamb. and Or.
read verum on the poorest authority. tum : cum, S ; cum eausa, T ;
the error is due to iudicium causa in the line above. 27. idem (or
idem illud) imp. per. conj. Lehmann, Herm. 1880, p. 571. 32. pos-
sint, ST. Possibly right.

50.—Page 19, 1. 6. eis, om. ST; his, many MSS. Kays. suggests
the omission of arbitrabantur.

XVIII.-8. P orn. ST 30annut1u8, STM ; Gamtius, F ;others Canutius,
9. quidem, om. T and others3 but then ille is left without any force.
V. explan. n. for meaning of quidem. 10. Pluygers brackets venenum
esse deprehensum, without reason. The insertion of sed. before omnia
would make the drift of the sentence much elearer. 1 1. constitueban-
tur, ST ; evidently wrong.

51.—20. All MSS. but ST have a gloss after possim, implere. im-
prudentiae, ST wrongly‚ and below (l. 24), imprudentissimae. Cp.§ 76,
l. 29, n.

XIX—26. laudari, ST‚wr0ng1y. Pluygers conjectures etiam . . .
defuisse for etiam si . . . defuissem, following Orelli. But v. explan.
n.‚ which justifies the irregularity of construction.

52.——32. quicquid ε v. explan. n. Perhaps with Bait„ Kays., and one or
two earlier edd„ we should read quicque. In de Fin. ii. ἓ 5, quicque is
confused with quicquid by two codd. : so in Verr. ii. 4. 31, 132, ubi quic-
quid ; unumquicquid are found in inferior codd. But it cannot be always
put down to the carelessness of copyists. Its existence in Lucr. is un-
doubted : auct. ad fflrenn. ii. ξ 47, gives quidquid (quicquid) for quicque
in all MSS. but one. It was in all probability a common colloquial error
in Cic.'s time. (Cp. Madv. de Fz’n. v· ἓ 24.) Pago 20, l. 1. After
Habito Kays. inserts fuissent. 6. fuisse, ST; esse, R. Edd. from

Classen follow ST. The sense demands it ι ‘ would have come if the plot ’
had succeeded,’ not ‘ were about to come ' : ‘ nam Cannutius in accusatione ξ
Scamandri ea tantum, quae perfecto nefario consilio facta forent, com· , 3
