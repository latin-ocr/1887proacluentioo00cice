216 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [LXX. 200

200. liberm, ‘of a son ἰ plur. of vague expression, presenting the
type rather than the individual. Cp. ἓ 31, fratris liberos vita privavit,
note. 24. orbata laetetur, a fine paradox. 2 5. pudorem, veritatem
virtutemque: cp. ἓ 196, first note. 26. levate hune aliquando sup-
plicem v., ‘it is not too late to raise up the suppliant who kneels before
you, after these years of groundless prejudice and peril.' Supplex, prop.
‘with bended knee’: so supplicium is used both of capital punish-
ment (received in a kneeling posture), and, sometimes, of supplication.
28. flammam invidiae: cp. §4, quasi in aliqua perniciosissima f. atque
in communi incendio. 30. posita sunt in vobis omnia, ‘whose all is
in your hands': v. Gloss. pono. 31. ‘ Whose deliverance many wish,
you alone can effect.'

201.—Page 77, l. 2. condonetis, ‘sacrifice.’ Cp. ἓ 109 n., ἓ 195,
110 huius honestissime actam vitam matris crudelitati condonetis.

LXXI.—3. si qua calamitas cet., dubitanter loquitur, ne quid a iudici-
bus contra leges timere videatur. 4. ne, ‘ assuredly’: as in Phil. ii.
ἓ 3, 110 tu, si id fecisses, melius famae, melius pudicitiae tuae consuluisses.
Sometimes wrongly spelt nae. 9. fortassis: for this archaic form
cp. ἓ 201, crit. n. prosequi, of one following a funeral, as in Ov.
Trist. i. 8. 14, dure ! nec exsequias prosequerere meas? Used also gener-
ally as the Greek προπέμπειν, ‘to escort.' 10. nunc, ‘as it is,’ con-
trasting the actual with the imagined z cp. ἓ 120 11. 11. luctum, prop.
grief as expressed by external signs, and especially by the dress. In the
case of a conviction, Cluentius would speedily be ‘in mourning' sor his
own living death : for such in effect would be the aquae et ignis interdictio.

Cp. what Ovid says of his own house as it appeared on the eve of his
banishment:

quocunque adspiceres, luctus gemitusque sonabant ε
formaque non taciti funeris intus erat (Tr. i. 3),

and also ξ 170, n. 011 exsulis testimonio.

zoa—15. putemus, consecutive subj.: R. 1680, r. 704. 16. ut
quisque crudelissime oppugnatur, eum lenissime sublevatis ε a propor-
tionis expressed‚ as in ἓ 57, ut quisque [morbus] est difficillimus, ita medicus
nobilissimus quaeritur, where v, n. A terser form of proportional sen-
tence appears in Sall. Catil. viii. ‚ prudentissumus quisque maxime
negotiosus erat. 14. nemo huie tam iniquus . . . vos, qui aequi
estis omnibus: ‘ no one, if we except the mother that bare him, has been
so malignant towards him that we may not believe his resentment to be
now fully satisfied: you, who are just and benignant towards all.' The
antithesis of aequus and iniquus must not be overlooked. The words
are difficult to translate: aequus combines the ideas of justice and benig·
m'ty as no modern word can do, now that the idea of justice has been
purged of everything emofional, and the rights of the individual are con-
ceived of as something inalienably his, not by grace of some one else,
