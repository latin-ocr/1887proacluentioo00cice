174 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XLVI. 129

who has not stood to his post but quailed before the furious charge of the
foe, may notwithstanding turn out afterwards a better soldier . . .’
32. idem has strong adversative force sometimes, especially when in
apposition to the subject of the sentence. The identity of the agent
heightens the contrast of the actions. So Hor. C. ii. 10. 15, informes
hiemes reducit Ι Iupiter, idem Ι summovet. Cp. ἓ 112, procedit
saepe longius quam si idem ille esset cum isdem suis vitiis nobilissimus,
where the contrast is between vitiosus et ignobilis and vitiosus et nobilis z
also ἓ 92, § 137. Sometimes the force of idem is merely augmentative,
like etiam: Hor. C. ii. 10. 223 de Off? i. ἓ 43, nihil liberale quod non
idem iustum. 33. amplior: V. crit. n. for the meaning.

129—Pago 49, l. 3. censor is secondary predicate, not voc., as the
older edd. understood it. 6. velis can only be justified as a potential subj.
‘as you may wish 'z Lamb. and Orelli were perhaps right in emending it voles.
It must not be explained, with class„ as due to ul=utcunquc. The indic.
is used with indefinite rel. adjectives and adverbs z the only real exception
being the use ofplup. and sometimes imperf. subj. in Livy and later writers
to denote cases frequently occurring (‘ whenever ') t R. 1716, r. 721. But
in other cases, if the subj. ever occurs, it requires some special explanation ε
eng. Plaut. T rin. 436, di duint tibi quaequomque optes (by attractz'on).1
Contrast Plzz'l. ii. ἕ 1 18, mecum uti voles (sc. redibis in gratiam) ε ‘ be recon-
ciled to me or not, as you like.' 7. vidente: V. Glossary. 9. quem·
quam, ‘any single citizen (not to say more than one or two, plures) ’:
emphatic by its position. 12. praefectus moribus: cp. n. on ἓ 119,
l. 19. magister veteris d. et s., ‘ a -graduate in the stern school of
ancient virtue.' 16. condicionem: v. Glossary. 20. factum esse

oportuit : the use of the perf. inf. after oportet is confined to the Comic ,

poets and Cic., and seems to have been colloquial. Its use after verbs of
desz‘rz‘ng (especially volo) is analogous, and is also seldom to be found in
authors other than Cic. and the Com. poets. Cp. ἓ 90, accusatum oportuit
(note and reffi). Originally the tense of the inf. had its full meaning of
completed action ε cp. § 13, filium interfectum cupit. But in cases such as
this it is indistinguishable in translation from the pres. inf., though it may
lend a tone of impatience or peremptoriness to the expression. This
usage is commonest in the passive voice, the auxiliary esse being generally
omitted: Verr. ii. 4. 37, signum ablatum non oportuit3 Catil. ii. § 27,
illos . . . monitos etiam atque etiarn volo. We may also cp. the use of
the past part. with opus in such expressions as properato opus est. R.
1371 a and d, 12563 r. 545, 541 b. sortiri . . . committere, ‘to
ballot for punishment, and so to submit a question of criminal conduct to
the arbitrament of chance’: et· is explanatory, as so often after multus: multi
et graves dolores, ‘many severe pains.’ Cp. ἓ 2, altera pars et ea quae,
cet. 22. 111, ‘in the case of’: i.e. ‘ where the offenders are many.'
Cp. n. 0n§ 32, in eadem iniuria.
