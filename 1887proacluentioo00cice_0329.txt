Lx. 167] CRITICAL NOTEs. 265

LX. 165.-Pag0 64, l. 7. All MSS but ST have G. before Vibium.
cappadocem, ST b (corr.); a cognomen found in two inscrr. ε other MSS.
have Cauponem or capacem 3 the latter Bait. Kays. adopt. We cannot get
any conclusive arguments from internal evidence. That he stayed at Rome
with a hospes is not evidence that he was not a Roman citizen, but an Asiatic
(Cappadox). He may have been an Italian. Ry. argues that C. Vibius
Cappadox would be ‘ the Asiatic freedman of some C. Vibius,' and no fit
guest for a senator. Is it not equally probable that he was at once an
Italian born, and surnamed Cappadox from some exploit in the Mithra-
datic wars? Vibius is a Samnite name, but one which made its way
to Rome, according to Momms. Unterz'tal. Dial. p. 242. We find a
SeX. Vibius at Larinum, §25 11. After mortuus MSS. (except STF
and others) read ‘aut heres est. Cluentius,' emended at (haud Lamb.)
heres est Cluentius by edd. Plainly ‘haud h. est C.' was interpolated
by those who thought the transition from est mortuus to intestatum
dico esse mortuum abrupt, if not a vain repetition. But Cic. inten-
tionally repeats and amplifies : . . . intestatum (this is the emphatic word)
dico esse mortuum3 z'.e. had Cluentius been a captator or legacy-hunter,
the man would have made his will in time. 13. ex edicto praetoris,
ST: praetoris edicto, R.

166.—19. Babuttium, ST 3 Balbuttium‚ M. 21. hoc ego . . . plur-1-
bus (om. verbis) dicerem, Quint. ix. 2. 48: ‘I suspect that Quint. is
right‚' Prof. Nettleship. The sentence is neater without verbiS, which 1
bracket. bibisse Pluygers brackets. 22. per quae, ST3 quae,
R. Both constructions are Ciceronian: haec quae ego nunc percurro,
Balb. ἓ 50, per omnes civitates . . . percurrit oratio mea, Verr. ii. 111. ἓ
100. Intransitive verbs compounded with a preposition often become
transitive in usage: a tendency which, beginning in classical times, is
found in later Latin in full development ; ag. percurro transitive is classi-
cal, percurso is post-classical. The poets did much to confirm this
tendency.

167.-23. quid umquam . . . accederet: Davies in Hermathen„ vol.
ii. p. 396, suggests that these words belong tog 170, as they make no
sense here: ‘Why could not the younger Opp. utter a word against
Cluent. in this very trial? Sure enough he is the prosecutor. It is he
who says everything: everything that Accius pleads. He is at the
moment enjoying and exercising the full rights of a Roman citizen. The
lines refer to the elder Opp. who was an exile, civilly dead, and belong to
the following context ἓ 170, quo tandem metu adductus . . . conatus est?
quid umquam Habitus . . . Opp. metuebat cum z‘lle . . . accederet ἒ
Quid erat quod iarn Opp. . . . quisquam timeret ? quid 77zetuebat?' The
four words in italics, he says, indicate the argument. If Cluent. tried
to poison the elder Opp. the probable motive would be fear. Now what

“ could he fiar in him? In the case of the younger Opp. the sear could

not, even rhetorically, be denied. Ι think Ι have shown, in the explan.
