ANALYSIS.

wife then was pregnant, and a sum to her only in the
event of the child’s birth. Mark his suspicions of
Oppianicus. But he was too short-sighted. Oppi-
anicus bribed her to procure abortion‚ and the whole
inheritance fell under the will to Oppianicus the
younger.

(ἓ 36) By the help of Avillius, a sharper, he decoyed
Asuvius, a rich youth of Larinum, to Rome, and had
him murdered at the Esquiline gate ; Avillius having
previously duly executed a will under Asuvius’ name.
(ἓ 38) Avillius was taken before Q. Manlius, then
triumvir, and confessed all, but (ἓ 39) Oppianicus
when arrested bribed Manlius.

(ξ 40) He then procured L. Clodius, a quack of Ancona,
to poison Dinaea and (ξς 41) sorged a will in her
name. He even tampered with the archives of
Larinum. He was universally hated, yet Cluentius
would have lest him unassailed, but (ξ 42) after the
attempt on his own life he had no choice.

B.—PL0T AGAINST CLUENTIUS.

(gg 43, 44) It happened thus ε Oppianicus declaring certain
priests of Mars at Larinum to be Roman citizens, the
Larinates prevailed on Cluentius to appear against

him sor thern at Rome. Hence he came into col·⁴

lision with Oppianicus. Resides, he had made no
will, and Oppianicus designed to kill him, so that
Sassia should inherit his property, and thereafter to
kill Sassia. (ἓ 46) He had two friends, rogues of
Larinum, the Fabricii. (ἓ 47) Cleophantus, a doctor
then attending Cluentius, had a slave Diogenes.

, Oppianicus set C. Fabricius on to corrupt this slave.
He revealed it to his master, and after consultation
with Cluentius and Baebius, a senator, atrap was laid.
Cluentius bought Diogenes, and poison was seized
in the hands of Scamander, a sreedman of Fabricius.
(ξ 48) With guilt so plain, how can Oppianicus' conviction
be called corrupt, or Cluentius be said to have prose-
cuted otherwise than perforce? (ἐξ 49 and 50) Sca-
mander was tried first; pressed by friends of Fabricius
from Alatrium, I undertook the defence. (ἓ 51)amost

case. I could make no way, and throughout it was
