suspected of having been too free with his tongue, and too loyal to his
master.' Pago 68, l. Ι. puer ε for the age of Opp. the younger, cp.
Introd. The word cannot be pressed : cp. L. and Sh. sub voc. puer,
and n. on puero non grandi, ἓ 179; it is used of Octavius at the age of
nineteen, ad Fam. ii. 1. 2. 3. Advocantur amici: cp. the case of Sex.
Roscius (R. Am. ξ 77), who similarly called in his friends and demanded
his dead father’s slaves, for examination touching his death, of T.
Roscius, who then held his property: vobis advocatis, vobis agentibus,
duos servos paternos in quaestionem ab adversariis Sex. Roscius postula-
Δ bat. 5. homines . . . ornati: an admission on the advocate's part,
if the principle of ‘noscitur a sociis' holds. Contrast the closing words
of § 170, quemnemo recipere tecto, nemo adire, nemo adloqui, nemo
aspicere vellet. For ornati V. Gloss. 6. cum essent animi servorum
et spe et metu temptati, ‘when alike promises and threats had been
tried upon the slaves) Cp. ἓ 47, spe et pretio sollicitare3 Sest. ξ 34,
et spe et promissis tenebat. 8. auctoritate advocatorum atque vi
tormentorum adducti: very difficult words. (1) Class. takes them as
ironical: ‘ Si quid miseros illos ad confitenda etiam quae non commisis-
sent permovere potuisset, adduxisset certe auctoritas advocatorum et vis
tormentorum: quum tamen nihil fassi sint, curn acerbo risu illud con-
stantiae causam fuisse dicit orator, quod minime esse potuit, et verarn
causam, quam sponte quisque intellecturus erat, reticet innocentiae con-
.scz·entz·am.’ (So in effect P.) That is, Cic. gives as reasons for their
adhering to the* truth what were really incentivgs to falsehood. Now no
doubt Class. does not understand auct. advocatorum, or the words homines
bonesti, cet„ as simple sarcasm. Nevertheless, unless we are to take atque
vi torm. as a παρὰ ’προσδοκίαν (which would be quite out of place in an
almost pathetic narrative), the two ablatives are on exactly the same
footing. That is, Cic. is made to imply that the ‘ auctoritas ’ of these
men was not an inducement to veracity. The whole tone of the chapter
forbids that. (2) The words, if they are to stand at all (about which
v. crit. n.), must be taken as serious. ‘ Influenced by the moral support
of the witnesses, and the very violence of the torture‚’ which produced
the opposite effect to that intended by Sassia, and, instead of wringing
the falsehood from them that she wished, made them in dogged spite
adhere to the truth.

are brought into requisition.’ 13. adversari . . . furere: for the

historic infin. cp. ξ 59 note. 15. ea . . . procedere: the acc. and
infin. dependjonfumre, or rather on the idea of irasci contained in it. So
the emotion felt and its symptoms are identified in the use of tremisco,
with an object clause, Verg. A. xii. 916, telum instare tremiscit, and of
tremisco tremo trepido with acc. of object. Such sense-constructions are
commonet in Greek: ag. ἐκπλαγῆναι with acc. Cum iam tortor
