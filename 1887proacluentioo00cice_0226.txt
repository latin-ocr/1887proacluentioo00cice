at this result.'—Ry. Cp. n. on ἓ 87, l. 31. 10. aliqui: cp. ἓ 7, l. 7n.,
l. 12: substantival. 11. eos, a rhetorical plur. The reference is of
course to Falcula. So Verr. i. ἓ 39, of the same circumstance: quod in·
venti sunt senatores qui . . . exirent in eum reum quem incognita causa
condemnarent. It has the effect of making the assertion or denial more
comprehensive. (Cp. for another use liberos, ἓ 31 n.) 12. puta-
bitur: v. crit. n. 16. aliquid (not quidquam), ‘some particular
element,’ as opposed to m'lzil ε cp. ἓ 109, l. 6 n. The concession of
the adversary‚ ‘potuit esse innocens Falcula,' with the emphasis on
Falcula, is taken to imply ‘but others were guilty: there was some
reason in F.'s case for his giving the verdict of guilty, other than a bribe.’
Cp. crit. n. here.

114—18. The effect of the position of tu (with its relative clause) is to
emphasise‚ by separating, the two parts of the dilemma. ‘ You must either
{ind fault with one of your vaunted legal decisions, or you must accept it
and, by implication, allow that the condemnation of Opp. was not bought.'
21. Quamquam, ‘ and yet,’ introducing a reservation, ‘ (I have given you
an unanswerable argument 3) and yet . . .,’ R. 2215, r. 871 (6); οὐ μὴν
, ἀλλά in Demosth. 34. ex tam multis iudicibus: those who tried
Opp. 22. For the construction of damno cp. ἓ 32, ἓ 97, notes.
23. mim, the so-called ethic dative: cp. ἓ 97, tu mz'lzi ex tota causa
Bulbi, quod tibi commodum est, eligis: and ν. n. on ἓ 75, l. 14. ‘A
person accused of ambitus was charged with having given money for an
unlawful purpose—one aecused de repetundis of having received money
unlawsully.’-Ry. Cp. ἓ 98, where the two are contrasted. 27. pro·
pria lege 3 the lex de repetundis, or the lex Cornelia de sicariis.

115.—29. qua quisquo . . . lege factus esset: the plup. is really fre-
quentative, as in ἓ 52, apprehenderam: the mood is assimilated to
that osperz'ret3 that is, it is an integral part of the consequence stated:
‘ If this charge of yours was so effective that, no matter under what law
each of these jurors was impeached, the fatal blow was always given in
that form, why was it that the rest were not impeached when accusers
were so plentiful and rewards so high ? ' (Not as P.) He refers in illis
iudicibus to the jurors actually condemned, such as Bulbus and Staienus.
For in ‘in the case of,' giving the circumstances, cp. ἓ 32, in eadem

33. A short paraphrase of this somewhat difficult passage may not
be out of place: ‘ Here I am confronted with the litis aestimatio
against S.‚ though it ought not to be adduced as alegal decision. 1 am
speaking before good lawyers ; and it is not necessary to explain at any
length what a lit. aest. is. But anyhow, the strict care which charac-
terises all other trials is no longer to be expected when once the verdict
