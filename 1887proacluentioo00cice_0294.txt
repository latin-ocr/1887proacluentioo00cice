230 CRITICAL NOTES. [xl11s37 1

by connecting recenti with sermone. The reading of cod. Franc. and .

Wramp.'s MSS„ quam clara tum reeens fuit (which gives the old vulgate
reading quam clara cum recens ruit) was a less ingenious emendation.
τὸ ἁμαρτάνειν πολλαχῶς ἔστιν. 24. quam in ommam, ST. 25.
Av1111us, PST always ; Avfflus, Aiullus, are other readings. Larino,
PST3 Larinas, R; Halm conj. Larini homo. perdito a nequitiam
P. 27. accommodata, P, if we may trust the silence of Peyron, who
collated it with the text of Olivetus. Arusianus Messius (p. 452, ed.
Keil) quotes with accommodatum. The other Mss. have accommo-
datus: Class. and Ry. read it. The expression ars ad aliquid accommo-
data is unusual, this participle being generally applied as it is in 579,
infra. 32. iniri, STM, Lamb.‚ Or., Class. ; inire, PF, Ry., Bait. , Kays.
For the change of construction from pass. to act., cp. Madv. ad Cic. de
Fz'n. ii. , ἓ 21, quid attinet luxuriosis ullam exceptionem dari aut fingere
aliquos3 de Orat. ii.‚ ἓ 177, proponi oportet quid adferas et qua re ita sit
ostendere. It is generally after an impersonal verb ; but v. Liv. ix. 15. 5,
quoniam ab hostibus in se aequa statui quam in se ipsi ferre maluerint.
The passive form gives generality to that part of the statement. 33.
consilium, ST F M 3 id consfflum, P (if we may trust the silence of Peyron).
Ry. omits 111 before solitudine (surely a printer's error). Pago 14, l. 1.
Momms. conjectures, and Kl. and Miill. adopt, posse se—unnecessarily.
‘V. explan. n. here. Mun. in crit. n. on Caec. ἓ 25 gives a long list of
places in which the pronominal subject is omitted by all or by some MSS.
They cannot all be so readily doctored z ag. ἓ 55, 1. 3 ; ἓ 162, l. 14. 3.
secutus est, ST. qulbus connium, om. ST. 6. dicere mihi,
PSTM ; mihi dicere, F, Ry. Pluygers brackets mihi : cp. ἓ 107, longum
est . . . ita dicere. But it is unlike Cic. to leave the subject10f the part.
to be supplied.

37. ——8. ubi pernoctaret, ibi, P; ibi pernoctaret, ibi, ST, Ry.‚ and Class.;
ibi pernoctaret et, ibi, FM3 a few codd. (the Palatine and cod. S. Vict.
of Graevius and those of Wramp.) have ibi pernoctaret et ibidem
posterum commoraretur. The et is due to dittography: its intrusion

will account for the easy change of ubi to ibi in FM. Miill. conj. and reads ξ .

ubi pernoctarat, ib13 Kayser conj. ibi pernoctaret ibidem diem post.
comm. (Lamb., followed by Ern.‚ Or. , and others, had already conjec-
tured 1b1 pernoctaret. et, ibidem diem post. comm.) Probably Miiller’s
is the true reading, though I have hesitated to admit it in face of the
testimony of PSTF M. [Mr. Roby thinks ub1 pernoctaret indifferent
Latin : and would read as Miill. ‚ or else as Class.] 12. apponat ipse.
Testamento‚ P ; Bait., 141.. Miill. ‚ appellat ; ipse testamento, Lamb.‚ Or.,
class„ Ry. But Kayser omits ipse here, inserting ipse after Avuuus and
before 11100. Discedltur PFM ι discedit ST. Classen objects to the read-
ing of P on the ground that ipse lacks force at the end of the former
sentence, while it is ‘almost indispensable ' at the beginning of the next
sentence ; because the three actors in this drama of crime are distinctly to
