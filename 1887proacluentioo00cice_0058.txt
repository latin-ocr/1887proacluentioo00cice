ANALYSI S.

6tlz, Scaevola's Litis Aestimatio (ἓ 115), it is said, indirectly
found as a fact that Oppianicus’ trial was corrupt.
But it is a very informal proceeding: a Jury often
disregards its own Litis Aestimatio: and there were
plenty of other reasons for Scaevola's conviction. He
never was tried on this charge.

CH. XLII. (ἓ 117) 7tlz, The authority of the Censors. That is no
iudicium at all. (ἓ 118) Ι say nothing against him,
but it is not a judicial act. I owe that criticism to
my client, and they would admit its truth. (ἓ 119)
So that the censure of some of that jury counts for
nothing: why, C. Geta became censor aster having

XLIII· himself been censured! No infamy follows it, so it
can be no judgment. Anxious as our fathers were
for the purity of juries, they never made this a dis-
qualification. (ἓ 121) Juries disregard it: so do
praetors in choosing a jury panel : censors disregard
their predecessors’ ‘subscriptio,’ and even disagree

XLIV, between themselves. (ἕ 123) To treat censure for a
charge as proof of the truth of the charge would be
to arm the censors with tyrannous power.

§124 So their censure is irrelevant, and we get back
as before to the original facts. Nothing is proved
against Cluentius: (ἓ 125) you hear Oppianicus’

XLV. crimes. The censors (ἓ 126) themselves would admit
they followed mere rumour: their decision can be
questioned, as I successfully questioned it in Matrinius’
case. (ξ 127) Besides, why were Aquilius and

XLVI. Gutta alone censured? (ξ 128). There is no analogy
to decimation, (ξ 129) a censor should censure all

XLVII· who are guilty. (ξ 130) But they follow rumour;
and there were other judicial scandals then: they
seized on men they knew to be rogues. (ἓ 131)
But they heard no defence: Gellius the censor
could know nothing of Oppianicus, and (ἓ 132) as
to Popilius, Lentulus disagreed.

XLVIII. (ἓ 133) It is said they censured Cluentius himself: that
was owing to current scandal. (ἓ 134) They should
have followed Africanus' example in the‘ case of
Licinius Sacerdos.

(ἕ 135) 8ίΙι, There is Egnatius’ will, disinheriting his son

for corruption on Oppianicus’ trial: a very foolish ·
