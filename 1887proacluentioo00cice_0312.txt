248 CRITICAL NOTES. [xxxvn. 104

accepisse captam 3 (c) the use of the bare dixit for causam dixit (though the
technical DIXERVNT, ἓ 73, might be held to justify this). The last is met
if, with Prof. G. Ramsay, we punctuate at iudicandam, and read causam
for captam ; cp. l. 18 supr. (ii.) We may hope to find an adequate emen-
dation without abandoning the MSS. altogether. Madv. has given us a
brilliant conjecture: causam nusquam Staienus ea de re lege dixit.
He explains—finita prioris Fidiculanii absolutionis commemoratione, Cic.
antequam ad alteram transeat quam proprie ad rem pertinere dicit, rei
praeparandae causa breviter interponat, in Staieno huiusmodi iudicium,
quod proprie ad captae pecuniae crimen pertineat, nullum factum esse.
Madv. argues that the lege in his reading is not superfluous : Staienus in
his trial for maiestas had not to answer directly ‘(legitimo iudicio) for
corruption (captae pecunz'ae): yet it is hinted that the suspicion of his
criminality under the latter count did him little good as regards the proper
charge which he had to meet. While adopting this conjecture, I feel that
it labours under the same objection as the others in the difficult transition
which it assumes. (iii.) We may, with Classen, suppose that there is in
this passage ‘gravius mendum quam quod leni medela tollatur.’ So
apparently Kayser, who in his critical note suggests that some such words
as these have dropped out after iudicandam: pecumam, ut 1110, qul
maiestatis est damnatus, cum iudex pecuniam accepisset. causam
tamen nusquam [Staienus] ea quidem lege dixit. Any such suggestion,
if embodied in the text, amounts of course to original composition under
the name of Cicero. It may be allowable if kept in a critical note. The
argument, as I conceive it, could be briefly expressed as follows: ac-
cepisse ob rem iudicandam pecuniam. At videamus alteram [sc. ‘abso-
lutionem]. An usquam Staienus eadem lege dixit? (Or, Nam causam
nusquam st. e. 1. d..) Thus the transition is clearly marked. The fre-
quent repetition of the syllable -am might account for the confusion of the
text. Staienus, far from being doubtful (as Class. and Kays. suggest), is
indispensable here, to contrast with fidiculamus below. 31. crimen,
