imphes, ⁴quamquam multi sublati erant. So ἀλλά is used: ἔδωκας ἡμῖν
ἀλλὰ σὺν χρόνῳ χαράν, Soph. Tr. 201, ‘at length, though late,' εἰ μὴ
πρότερον being the ellipse. 23. oppressa. morbo est: according to
§40 she was poisoned by Oppianicus. 26. his diebus paucis, ‘a few
days after this.' Cp. Plaut. Poen. 871, his duobus mensibus ‘in the
next two months‚' ‘in two months’ time from now ' z v, ἓ 35, decem illis
mensibus, ‘in the next ten months‚’ ‘in ten months' time from then':
§ 37, brevi illo tempore, ‘a short time after that': ξ 108, paucis illis
diebus, ‘ a few days after that time,' All these are Ablatives of ‘ time in
the course of which.' R. 1182, r. 492. The Pronoun seems to be used
in agreement by a kind of attraction, for ab hoc tempore, ab illo tempore,
respectively. Only the context decides whether the time is reckoned
before or aster the given date: as is seen by comparing Verr. iv. ἓ 39,
paucis illis diebus, meaning ‘ a few days before that time,' with the last
preceding example.

VIII. 23.-30. ‘ Being a man of unique wickedness and daring.' ut
erat with the Abl. of quality is a common equivalent for quippe qui
esset with an Adjective. Cp. p. 27, l. 20, Sall. lug. 7, Iugurtha
ut erat impigro atque acri ingenio. 32. Gallicanum, v, supra.
33. Who is this A. Aurius? Two passageS‚.§ 25, Aurium illum

. . et alterum Aurium et eius L. filium; and ἓ 11, A. Aurio Melino

. . adulescenti in primis, ut tum habebatur, inter suos et honesto
et nobili, must be compared, together with ξ 26, Sassiam . . . cuius
virum A. Aurium occiderat, before we endeavour to answer this question.
A. Aurius has been confidently identified by Classen with A. Aurius
Melinus, whom we know Oppianicus to have murdered (ξ 26). He
argues: (a) that A. Aurius Melinus must have been one of the three
Aurii put to death together (ξ 25): (b) that he cannot be the ‘alter
Aurius' who had a full-grown son, for in ἓ 11 he is called adulescens,
which is applicable to ‘ a man of 30 to 40 years of age, but not upwardS.'
And the father of such a son must have been over 40. (c) Therefore
A. Aurius Melinus is to be identified with A. Aurius here. There are
one or two weak points in this. We have no right to assume (a) : Sylvius
may be right in suspecting that A. Aurius Melinus was murdered at
some other time: webdo not necessarily know every Aurius and Auria
then in existence, and their pedigree3 eg. Oppianicus’ brother was
married to an Auria otherwise unknown (ἓ 31). But if we assume
that Melinus was one of the three Aurii proscribed, we may, with Ramsay,
dispute (b). -L. Aurius may have been a mere child of four or five, the issue
of the marriage of A. Aurius Melinus with'Cluentia ε even if this be not so,
he may have been the son of a previous marriage of Melinus (which might
be easily assumed) 3 Melinus might thus be still ‘ adulescens ’ in the sense
assigned by Classen. But the word cannot be thus limited in its applica-
tion. If then Melinus is the ‘ alter Aurius‚' A. Aurius is a distinct person
introduced for tlze first time. The language of the passage seems to
