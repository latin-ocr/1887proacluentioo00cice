-180 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [κως. 137

nquiry into the conduct of those who were suspected of bribing jurors.
(Cp. n. on l. 32 supr.) Whereas the case of those who had taken bribes
was covered by the lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis and lex de repetundis.
The argument of Zumpt, that this resolution of the senate threatened the
latter class, and not the former, because C. Junius found himself imperilled,
cannot go for much. Any investigation of the facts was presumably
dangerous to him in its ultimate, even if not in its immediate, conse·
quences. There was therefore no existing statute which dealt (expressly
and without distinction of persons) with the offence of those who had
bribed. In two waJys only could justice be set in motion against them.
The offender might (as in the case of Cluentius) be accused under the sixth
chapter of the lex Cornelia de sic. et veneficis: but here a non-senator
might escape on the technical plea. Or the senate might call for a special
inquiry against him. (Cp. Fritzsche, Sull. Gesetzg. 25.) ΜΓ. Roby,
however, thinks that this s.c. was directed against all who took part in
corrupting a jury: cp. the language used of C. Junius in ἓ 92: and that
therefore there is no clear inserence from this to the eontents of the lex
Cornelia. 8. ‘Is this, upon the sace of it, a decision of the senate
that the offence has been committed, or an expression of its grave
displeasure in the event of its having been committed ? '

Varus (Zumpt). 15. 111 quos . . . decreverat, ‘on whom the senate
had devolved the same duty by decree.’ The consuls should have moved
the appointment of a quaestio in accordance with the suggestion of the
senate. The construction decernere z'n aliquem is not found elsewhere
with this meaning. ’ 17. quod H. pecunia. factum esse arg-uis is the
subject to factum est . . . illorum aequitate, as the chiastic arrangement
and the virtual repetition of factum est shows: thus the clause ut . . .
arbitrarentur is appended as an explanation of the subject. The sentence
neque id . . . confirmas is thrown in, attached loosely to quod . . .
factum esse arguis: Cic. might have written neque . . . confirmas instead,
carrying on quod. . . filetum esse as object. Similarly a relative is
sometimes continued in a second clause by a demonstrative or personal
pronoun, especially where the case changes: as in Hom. Od. ix. 19, εἴμ’
