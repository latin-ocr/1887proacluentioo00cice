PREFACE. vii

in the spirited Translation by Principal Peterson, to
which also I desire to record my obligations.

It remains that I should express my hearty thanks
to Professor H. Nettleship, at whose suggestion, indeed,
this edition was undertaken‚ for some notes and help
upon part of the proof-sheetS, and for much kind
counsel; to ΜΓ. Η. J. Roby for his untiring kindness
in carefully revising the proof-sheets of the whole book
(with the exception of part of the Critical Notes), and
for the many valuable notes and criticisms which he
has supplied3 to Mr. J. A. Hamilton, Fellow of Mag-
dalen College‚ Oxford, for the excellent Analysis which
appears under his name in the Introduction ; and
lastly‚ to Mr. J. H. F owler, of Trinity College‚ Oxford,
and Manchester Grammar School, for his kind revision

of the proof-sheets of the Introduction.
