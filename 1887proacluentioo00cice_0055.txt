as much Oppianicus' guilt as Scamander’s that was
at issue. (ἓ 55) On Oppianicus’ advice, Scamander
asked that the jury might retire. On the first day’s
pleading he was convicted by every vote but one,
and that one was Staienus’ own.

(ἓ 56) Next, Cluentius prosecuted Fabricius. (ξ 57) The
brothers Caepasii defended and (ἓ 58) Cannutius pro-
secuted ; but the case was so bad that they seemed to
be playing into his hands. The jury laughed at them.

C.—OPP1AN1cus’ TRIAL.

The same jury tried Oppianicus; how could they aequit
him and convict his tools? (ἓ 62) The prosecution did
not need to bribe; (ἓ 63) bribery there was; but by him
who risked most, and was twice convicted already.
(ξ 64) Either Cluentius or Oppianicusbribed, but
only one. That one was Oppianicus; (ἓ 65) beyond
doubt he employed Staienus. First on Scamander’s
trial, when Staienus alone acquitted 3 (ἓ 67) on F ab·
ricius’ trial even he could not aequit. So on the next
trial stronger measures were needed.

(ἓ 68) Two years before, Staienus had taken money to

being ready for more, he told Oppianicus (ἓ 69) that
he alone would manage the affair, and received ,g 5000.

Then, seeing nothing could suit him better than to pocket
it, and let Oppianicus be condemned, being needy
and greedy, (ἓ 70) he made this plan· (ἓ 71) To the
unprincipled he promised bribes (the rest needed no
incensing), namely‚ to Bulbus and Gutta, and then,
saying Oppianicus had thrown them over, incensed
thern against his employer.

(ξ 73) Rumours of corruption were afloat‚ and Cannutius
decided to take a verdict before matters went further.
Oppianicus thought Staienus had bought the sixteen
votes needed. (ἓ 74) So suddenly did the case close
that Staienus chanced to be arguing elsewhere.
Cluentius and Cannutius did not object to his absence,
but Oppianicus and L. Quinctius, then Tr. Plebis,
did3 and the latter went out and fetched him in
to vote. (ἓ 75) Oppianicus called for public voting
so as to make his jurors earn their money. The
upright looked at the corrupt to see which way they
