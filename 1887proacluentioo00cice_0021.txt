much as any man living to demolish. Republican Rome had
been tried and found wanting. It was reserved for the
Caesars to prop up for a few centuries longer the tottering
fabric of the Empire3 there was strength and soundness in
the provinces still. But for the moral diseases of their people
the rulers could do little 3 they could ‘but skin and film the
ulcerous place.' The cause of truth and purity was in the

ΙΙ. WAs CLUENTIUS AccUSED UNDER THE SIXTH CHAPTER
OF THE lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis?

speech for the prosecution was divided into two parts, the
one relating to a public scandal with which his client's name
had for years been unjustly associated—the alleged bribery of
the jurors in the trial of Oppianicus (invidia iam inveterata

For seven centuries there had existed only one instrument

party struggles and civil strife which had distracted Italy from
the time of the reforming efforts of the Gracchi, and which
