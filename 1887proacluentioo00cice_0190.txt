126 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xxl11.63

crit. n. 2. Fabricios, cp. n. on ἓ 59. 3. ina. iudicia . . . quibus in
iudiciiS, v. n. on p. 19, l. 1. 4. a Staieno solo, cp. g 55,
omnibus sententiis praeter unam, quam suam Staienus esse dicebat,
Scamander prima actione condemnatus est. 9. For the use of inquam
to emphasise the doubling of the same word or idea, cp. crit. n. on ἓ 65,
negate inquam meo loco. 10. exstat memoria, ‘ there is living memory
to appeal to.' Cp. crit. n. for the variant exstant memoriae. tabulae
publicae, cp. Sull. ἓ 42, indicium relatum in tabulas publicas, of the
evidence of the Allobroges against the Catilinarian conspirators ; Balb.
ξ 11, quod ille in tabulas publicas rettulisset, os the accounts of a provin-
cial governor; infr. ξ 86, haerebat in tabulis publicis reus et accusator,
of the official roll of cases to be tried. Thus tabulae publicae is used of
any kind of official document. ‘It is evident from this passage, and from
§99‚ that a record of the whole proceedings in criminal trials was care·
fully preserved, for we find Cicero appealing to the depositions of
witnesses taken several years before as documents readily accessible. ’—Ry.
13. in male diculneo, cp. hoc in beneficii loco petitum est ab Apronio,
Verr. ii. 3. 114. ln locum alicuius always means ‘to take the place
of ’z eg. Plzil. xi. ἓ 11, quid Bestiam? qui consulatum in Bruti locum se
petere profitetur: the implied idea of succederejustifying the accus. In
loco alicuius is ‘ in place of,' ‘ by way of,' ‘ as,' ἐν μέρει. male dietum
is similarly opposed to crimen elsewhere (Font. ξ 27), as a ‘slander' or
‘aspersion’ to a ‘formal charge ἐ cp. Ilduren. ξ 13, adripere maledictum
ex trivio aut scurrarum aliquo convicio.

63.—15. occurram, opposite of deesse: ἓ 43, tantae voluntati univer—
sorum Larinatium deesse noluit. 17. vocat . . . iam dudum: sor
the tense, cp. ἓ 7, iam per annos octo continuos . . . audiatur.
18. tacita, ‘ unexpressed'; ἓ 7, tacita hominum opinio; cp. n. on
ξ 6. ‘ Which seems to interrupt me with—“ What! you deny that the
jury on that trial was bribed?’'' ob-, of interruption: so in Verg.
lacrimis adfabar obortis, ‘ despite the tears that would rise' (A. iii. 492).
21. si incertum fuisset . . . veri similius tamen esset ε in this conditional
sentence instead of plup. we have imperf. in apodosis: expressing a con·
tz‘nuous state (or in this case a tendency) existing in past time subJect to the
condition expressed. 'This is the ordinary use of the imperf. subj. in the
apodosis (and, mutatis mutandis, the protasis) of conditional sentences,
where the reference is to past time: the use noted in ἓξ 45, 61, 105,
is exceptional. Cp. ξ 80, tum si dicerem, non audirer. It may
also denote an action supposed, contrary to the fact, to be already
occurring: the reference being to present time. So that ‘hoc si diceres
errares’ means (a) of past time, ‘had you been saying this, you would
(during that time) have been in the wrong ’3 (b) of present time, ‘had you
said (or been saying) this now, you would be (or have been) now wrong.’
[We may add the exceptional use in past time, ‘ supposing you to have said
this (you may or may not have said it), you would have been in the wrong. ’]
