xlii ⁴ INTRODUCTION.

A sixth wife can be supposed, if we distinguish the unnamed
widow of Cn. Magius from Papia, as Prof. Ramsay does.
The story seems sensational enough without this. Others
have identified the widow of Magius with Novia.

If Papia is rightly identified thus, of course she follows
Magia (sister of Cn. Magius) in or'der of marriage. The
relative ages of their sons adapts itself to this view. In
Β. c. 72 the younger Oppianicus, son of Magia, was still‘ puer'
(ἓ 176) when his father died: he married in B.c. 69: we
must thus suppose him to have been born about B.c. 90-87.
Papia’s son was a child at school when Oppianicus sent for
him in B.C. 82: thus he was perhaps born at some time
within the years B.c. 85-87. There is room for one other
marriage and burial (or divorce) before the year B.c. 82,
that of Novia: but scarcely, one would think, for more than
that one. It is noteworthy that Cluentia is the only wife
whom Oppianicus is accused of having murdered: the plural
uxores in ἓ 125 and elsewhere is rhetorical.
