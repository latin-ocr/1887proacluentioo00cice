XXVII. 73] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 133

ascendisset ad honores, nisi in facinore manifesto deprehensus poenas
legibus et iudicio dedisset. There were several familiae in the gens
Aelia with cognomina Lamia, Ligus, Paetus, etc. : Staienus had taken the
cognomen Paetus, therein showing more sagacity than the Sextus Aelius
who is ridiculed in Sest. ξ 69 for having assumed the ancient cognomen of
Ligus—‘ cognomen sibi ex Aeliorum imaginibus arripuit, quo magis
nationis eius esse quam generis videretur.' The tribe of the Ligures was
notorious for its treachery: Verg. A. xi. 715, vane Ligus, where Serv,
quotes Cato Originum ii., ‘ sed ipsi unde oriundi sunt exacta memoria, in·
litterati mendacesque sunt et vera minus meminere.' ex imagini-
bus Aeliorum, ‘ from the family tree of the Aelii ’ : imaginibus:stemmate.
On either side of the atrium in a Roman noble's house were placed the
imagines or wax masks (expressi· cera voltus, Plin. N. H. xxxv. 6) of his
ancestors, each in its little shrine (armarium, ναΐδιον, Polyb.) ; attached to
each was a titulus declaring the honours achieved in life by the man
portrayed‚ and from one to another painted lines were drawn to express
the pedigree which connected them. Only families in which curule office
had been attained enjoyed the right to display these (the z‘us imaginum ;
cp. Glossary on nobilitas). When a funeral took place in the family, the
masks were taken out of their shrines and worn by persons who walked
before the bier in the garb and with the insignia (including the lictors)
which had belonged to the deceased ancestor: so that the Roman
noble was literally preceded to the grave by his ancestry. On this
subject Plin. N. Η. 35. 6, Polyb. 6. 53, JuV. viii. 1, are loci classz'ci3
v, Prof. Mayor on the last. Consult also Rich, Dz'ct. Ant. art.
