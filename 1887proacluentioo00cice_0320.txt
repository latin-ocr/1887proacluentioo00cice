and so Kays. Mull. ; sortitione, R. 33. qui . . . deliquerat, ST ; ne
. . . delinqueret, R. The former reading is much to be preferred:
(a) because it gives the best connection in sense between this and the
previous sentence: qui . . . deliquerat is parallel to miles qui locum
non tenuit: the former sentence states a principle: the latter its illus-
tration in old Roman practice. (b) It keeps up the parallelism of the
things compared: the offence of the cowardly soldier, as that of the
corrupt juror, lcas been committed : it is not prospective. (c) The time of
the two parts of this sentence quare . . . comparata est is identical. With
the reading ne . . . delinqueret: (a) the connection with the previous
sentence is by no means so easy. It is harsh to take miles generic (‘a
soldier') out of miles qui l. n. tenuit, ‘a runaway soldier' as subject to
' the verb : yet we must do this with this reading: otherwise iterum would 4
be necessary, ‘lest the runaway should fail agaz‘n.' (b) With miles
generic as subject, we must take Ry.'s explanation: ‘ on the one hand,
to prevent a soldier from shrinking from his duty in the fight, they held
up to him beforehand the terrors of condign punishment in the most

comprehensive form; but, on the other hand, when the offence had
actually been committed by numbers, they had recourse to sortitio)
But there is nothing to show that Cic. refers the one clause to the time
before the battle, the other to that after it, and (c) the force of the com-
parison is thus weakened—Mr. Peterson gives a note of Prof. Nettleship ε
the reading qui . . . deliquerat ‘seems to give the sense imperatively
required by the whole passage. “ For a soldier who has deser-ted his post
(tenuit perfect) may be afterwards, nevertheless, a better soldier, etc.
Therefore if a man lzad behaved badly in war from sear of the enemy, our ’.
forefathers held before him a greater sear—that, namely, of punishment f
and death,'’ etc. The point of the passage is that the decimation takes s'
place after the act of cowardice, in order to punish a few by death, and
the majority by tlze terror of death: amplior metus being the agony of
sear endured by the soldiers while waiting to see on whom the lot will ζ,
sall. This sear, and the sight of their comrades' punishment, will act ,
both as a punishment for the past, and a deterrent for the future. But J
