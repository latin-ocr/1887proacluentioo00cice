[Ι see no reason for' taking this otherwise than ‘ by Cluentius.' See §5 4, 84,
104, 124, ete., where it is clear that Cluentius was charged with the bribery.
-H. J. R.] 8. tulerit, ‘ Cp. ad Fam. i. 7. 6, quid res quid eausa quid

tempus ferat, tu optime perspicies, “what is involved in” 3 thus here, “what '

ffl‘lawsully belongs to the case as it really is '⁹ (ipsa).'—H. N. in P. In fact
tulerit=attulerit‚ or secum tulerit; v. Glossary. 9. conflarit: the word
means properly (α) ‘to blow into flame,’ of lighting a furnace to fuse
metal: (b) ‘to smelt together,’ of fusing the metal itself. Two meta-
phorical senses correspond: (a) ‘to excite’ or ‘work up,’ ag. conflare
periculum; Rosc. Am. ξ 5, eius rei quae conflavit hoc· iudicium; infr.
ξ 18, malum conflatum et profectum ; ξ 79, illi iudicio invidiam infamiam·
que esse conflatam: ἓ 95: ἓ 169: (b) ‘to work together' or ‘concoct,’
as here, and Lig. ἓ 34, consensum conspirantem et paene conflatum:
frequently with a suggestion of underlzand dealing. And in Sest. 366,
(quae ratio aut flandae aut conflandae pecuniae non reperiebatur), the
word must denote the ‘ coin'ing of base money‚' in contrast with flandae,
the regular expression for striking money, which latter appears in the
title given to a triumvir monetalis, auro mgento aeri flandoferz'undo. ‘I
shall enable you to judge of the composition of the case—which elements
in it are the contribution of truth‚ which the importations of misconcep-
tion, which the forgeries of prejudice.’

10.—13. descenderit: this verb is often used in reference to the
Forum and Campus Martius, which were on a low level as compared
with the rest of Rome. Phil. ii. ἓ 15, hodie non descendit Antonius,
sc. in forum; Hor. C. iii. Ι. 10, descendat in Campum petitor3 Sest. ἓ 88,
descendit ad accusandum. Probably there is also an idea of ‘ descending
into the arena’ of the law court or elections: cp. καθήκειν, καταβαίνειν.
‘ By my honour and responsibility as an advocate ' 3 defensioni belongs to
fide as well as qfficz'o: cp. ἓ 118, fides huius defensionis, ‘my loyalty in
his defence.' 17. satisfacere, ‘ to >act fairly by‚’ ‘ to dQ,„Qneffs.v,dutygby ' 3
an expression taken from busine-s's life. ‘ 1f1 fail now to discharge the
claims which Cluentius has upon me.’ Cp. ἓ 29, naturae et legibus s. s.
nl rightly read by Classen: being equivalent in sense to si nem, as
Cicero and the Comedians use it. Ni generally introduces, with them, a
negative condition, nisi an exception. Cp. the use of m* in a sponsio or
wager, ag. Plaut. Epz'd. 698, ni ergo matris filiast Ι in meum nummum,
in tuum talentum pignus da, ‘bet me a talent to my drachma, {f she is
not . . .,' zze. ‘I will bet you a drachma to a talent that she is . . .’
Though ‘ an exception osten has the effect of a negative condition,’ and
though later writers, such as Livy, neglect the distinction between nisi
and m‘, an original distinction in sense exists, as the following passage
shows—Cic. Off iii. ἓ 113, decem illi, quos iuratos ad senatum misit
