272 CRITICAL NOTES. [var. 190 ζ

plans without taking her into his confidence) ἐ with ⁸1 ‘ supposing that
(something) had thus been conceived by him‚' si quicquam esset sine

all codd. but four inferior ones, which read istum, and so Lamb., Or. , Ry. 3
T omits accusatorem. 4. muneribus; Lamb. has muliebribus; 80, ρ

Mtill. itaque, Or. ; itaque quod, Lamb. (conj. ?): Miill. suggests that
itaque may be right, comparing Caec. ἓ 71, itaque in ceteris controversiis

which forms the conclusion introduced by itaque. V., however, explan.
n. 7. dissidia, many older edd. wrongly: cp. Madv. de Fin. (excursus
ii). vidimus, STF, Kays, Mun„ KL: videmus, M, Ry., Bait.‚ to
which Miill. inclines. But the perfect of customary action in an inde·
pendent clause, a kind of gnomic perfect, is allowable in Ciceronian prose
if introduced by a temporal adverb Such as nunquam, saepe, from which
indeed it derives its force z otherwise it is only found in dependent clauses
or passim in poets and prose of the silver age. Cp. Hor. C. iii. 2. 29,
saepe Diespiter 1 neglectus incesto addidit integrum: and Cic. de Orat.
iii. ἕ 52, nemo umquam est oratorem, quod Latine loqueretur, admiratus.

ings. Afraternorum (ST and most), maternorum (some inferior ⁷
codd.) ; other conjectures are venafranorum (Victorius), which is further V
from the reading of ST, Alfaternorum (Gruter) which takes us too far from ς
Sassia’s route. Pago 74, 1. 1. Larino atque illam, all MSS. As Madv. ‘
says, atque illam should subjoin some particular attribute of mul. Lam'no,
but this it does notdo, and is therefore absurd. He reads (Adv. ii. 201). π
Larino atque illim usque a mari sup., apparently meaning ‘a woman i
from L., that is all the way from the shore of the Adriatic ' z a question· ³
able piece of Latin surely. Pluygers reads Larinatem ffla: the onlookers, j
