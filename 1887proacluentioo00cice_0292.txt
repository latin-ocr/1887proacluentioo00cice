228 CRITICAL NOTEs. [x. 30

quem hoc dicam, quaeris? non in eum, [in] quem vis [me dicer-eL v. Madv.
de Fin. p. 71. But this rule does not cover the present passage.
12. omneS, ST b (corn), om. R. Ry. argues that it should be omitted,
because it ‘ destroys ' the contrast with the corresponding clause—de eo
quem odisse iam non potestis, by ‘introducing the community at large.’
But on examining the balanced clauses we find that each of the former
set is amplified in each of the latter ε omnes still includes the jurors (‘ illi’),
‘ they with every one else.' 15. cannutio, ST ; cannuntio, F; canutio,
M.

30.—17. posset, ST. 20. propriora, ST and many inferior codd.‚
including those of Lamb. huiusce, S, and in all probability T; huius,
R. 21. in memoria, T pr. m. 26. fuit: fuisset, ST. 28. emori,
ST; mori, R. The e lost by confusion with the termination of the
previous word. ‘ Emori Ciceroni est misere mori ε sic infra, c. xiv. 42,
accusare quoquo modo posset, quam illo modo emori maluit,’ Class. Cp.
ἓ 187 n. 30. repentinam, ST ; tam repentinam, R. vocesque, ST
and inferior codd. 3 vocemque, FM and others. The piural is the more
difficult reading, but (like voczferatz'one) it implies that the cry of agony
was repeated.

XI. 31.—Page 12, l. 4. Auria : Iulia, ST ; Iuria or viria, M. 5.
putaretur, ST b (corr. ); videretur, R. 6. illud. quod, STF and inferior
codd. ; illa quod, M ; illa et quod, some inferior codd.‚ followed by Graev.,
Ern.‚ Or. Besides that this last reading is tautological‚ it obscures the main
purpose of Opp., which was to remove the child which stood between him
and his brother’s inheritance. 8. mortis: Gruter wished to delete
this word, and Schiitz does delete it. Ι am tempted to bracket it.
13. lucem, ST ; propriam lucem, R. 13. nihil ei clausum, om. S pr.
m. . . . Ei sanctum, S pr. m. I bracket clausum nihil. 15. custodiae t.
potuissent, ST; custodia t. potuisset, R. The plural, which is the harder

Ξ

reading, can only be attributed to the principle of ‘ concinnity ’ ε it answers f τ’

liberos.
to32.—17. secundiS, om. ST. Kays. omits; Bait., M‘ull. bracket3
Classen retains. Quintilian (v, infr.) has it. 21. Quanto est: from
this to ἓ 38, l. 23, triumvir constituunt, we have P. Quanto est . . .

cruciatum, Quint. viii. 4. 11, reading vim atque cruciatum: perhaps
objecting to the hysteron proteron. But mors atque cruciatus appears
elsewhere: Verr. V. ἓξ 72, 134, 138, 153. ‘Mortem corporis is at first
sight a strange expression, but Cic. may have used it to, heighten the
contrast. Opp. killed his victim. The woman at Miletus survived the ζ·
forced abortion.' H. J. R. [‘This may possibly be right, vim atque J,
cruciatum=violent torture. Cp. Verr. v. ἓ 138, mortem cruciatumque,
which perhapsza death of torture,' H. N. ap. Ρ.] 22. iniuriam, P.
26. corpore, S. ipsa, STP and inferior codd. 3 ipsam, R, including F.
29. Pluygers conj. Oppianicus unus inventus est. 27. multos, ST ¹
and Lambinus' MSS„ Class. ; plures, R, followed by Orelli, Ry., Bait„
