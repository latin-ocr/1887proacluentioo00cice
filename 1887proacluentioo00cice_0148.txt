84 EXPLANATORY No‘rEs. [11. 6

aut beatos . . . aut non miseros. The second alternative is the
weaker statement, and conciliates assent. Cp. Div. z'n Caec. ξ 41,
aut nemo aut pauci, inverted in Greek ἤ τις ἢ οὐδείς. ‘With resig-
nation, if not with positive pleasure.' Contrast use in ἓ 48, 1. 16.
32. dicam et diluam, Indicatives, as peroraro, p. 3, l. 23 although the force
of postulo extends to these dependent clauses, the Indic. is irregularly used z
this is sometimes the case where the oratio obliqua depends on a verb in
the first person, ξ 158 n. ; de Fin. i. ἓ 53, concedo . . cadere causa, si
qui aliter existimant. This is the virtual explanation of the mood of potuero,
p. 3, l. 14. For the combination of verbs cp. Verr. a. pr. ἓ 33, dicendo
ac diluendis criminibus contendere. 33. sint ε the mood contrasts
with that of erit praeteritum, p. 3, l. 2. It is to be explained (without
regard to the oblique petition ne . . subiciatis of which it forms a part)
as signifying ‘ hypothetical ' as opposed to ‘ definite and particular' objec—
tions : while in the Indic. below Cicero’s modesty admits that he would
make actual omissions. 33. taciti cog-uatium vestrae subiciatis
. . . [animo] requiratis ι Classen notes, ‘Animo requirere nihil aliud est,
quam quod modo dixerat ; tacitum cogy'tatz'onz' subiicere : quod enim inter
ipsam defensionem iudices facere vetuit orator, id ut faciant absoluta oratione
hortatur.' The identity of the expressions can scarcely be made out.
The former of the two refers to any damagz'ng· fact which might occur to
the listener’s mind traversing the point which the orator had just made z
the latter to the explanation of this fact which upon a retrospect of the
speech the same listener might seek in vain. A concrete example may
set the matter in a clearer light. Cicero alleges, as one of two probable
motives which led Oppianicus to attempt the murder of Cluentius, his wish
to possess himself of the property of the latter, an object which was to be*
consummated by the supplementary murder of his own wife Sassia, to
whom it would pass by will. The juror might call up in thought (tacitus
subicere) an adverse fact—O. would not gain, by Cluentius’ murder and
its supplement, his alleged object—the possession of his property. For
there would remain two reversionary heirs (Cluentia, her daughter by
Cluentius the elder, and, in the second place, her daughter by A. Aurius
Melinus, who is mentioned in§ 179). Cicero asks him to note the missing
link in the argument (requirere) at the close, instead of mentally interfer-
ing with his argument as he develops it: that is (in the case supposed),
to cast about for some explanation that might have been offered—such
as, that a murder more or less was nothing to O., and he was prepared to

send Sassia’s heirs after her—and to note that it was not offered (animo ,

requirere). If animo adds anything to the sense, it must express this ·
evolution of a hypothesis in the juror’s mind, which he seeks in vain in

the orator’s desence3 v. crit. n. 33. taciti, of thought unexpressed ι
