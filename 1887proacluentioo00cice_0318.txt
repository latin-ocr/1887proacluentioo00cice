254 CRITICAL NOTEs. [xnv. 127 ’

As Class. says, we should expect gravissimum, ⁴ put forward their strongest
plea‚’ answering to quicquam aliud. But in manuscript, as in speech,
corruption attacks words in their extremities first of all. Pago 48,
l. 8. reliquisse subscripserunt, TF and others 3 so Class, Bait., reliquisse
seripserunt, S; reliquissent, R, vulg, Ry. (reliquisse se subscripserunt,
Kays., Kl.‚ Muli„ but v. n. on ἓ 36, 1. 1). Classen objects to the vulgate
reading on the ground that the mere leavinga man among the aerarii-—
where he was before—would have been no stigma3 subscripserunt, they
drew attention to the fact that they had done so—(of course this argument
falls to the ground if we admit that aerarium relinquere:aerarz'umfacere;
but the evidence for this is insufficient. V. explan. n. on this point)—
Ramsay’s objection to the reading of TF, that subscribere properly denotes
not the affixing of the nota, but the assignment of the reason for its
affixing‚ deserves consideration. [Thus Ascon., Cic. in tog. cand., p. 84,
Orell. ι hunc Gellius et Lentulus censores . . . senatu moverunt causasque
subscrz'p5erunt, quod socios diripuerit cet. Cp. also§ 131, which gives a
specimen of such a subscriptio] But the case of D. Matrinius is excep-
tional 3 he was not ‘ aerarius sactus,’ ‘ in aerarios relatuS,' but ‘in aerariis
relictus’: the subscriptio to his name must have been exceptional too,
and have stated the fact as well as the reason (‘in aerariis relictus est,
quod . . .'). Then subscribere mayz‘state in a subscrz'ptz'o’ (pregnant
force) as excusare and defenderer-‘state in excuse, in defence.' If this
does not commend itself, at any rate the reading of S is preferable to the
vulgate. 11. dixerunt, STF. Cp. ἕ 121, 1. 14.

127.——12. subscripserint, F; from this place to ἓ 132, opinione standum,
M is wanting. 14. et intimum Guttam, S. 15. dinant: ‘prorsus
ridicula est exhortatio illa, ut censores aliquid dicant‚' Madw, who also
objects to Baiter's reading (v. below), which subordinates the infin.
sentence to the question quid. est hoo? Accordingly he suggests quid
est hoc ? duos esse corruptos solos pecunia iudicant: ceteri videlicet
gratis condemnarunt.

Orelli has q. e. hoc? d. e. c. ε. pecunia? quid ceteri? v. g. e., but
there is no good MS. authority for the second quid. Bait., q. e. hoc?
cl. e. c. s. pecunia? dicant: ceteri v. g. c. I follow Classen and K1.:
Ry. has marks of interrogation at dicant and condemnarunt.

Madv.'s emendation is not needed; dicant (censores being subject)
introduces the first alternative, adferant in l. 20 the second ; v. note there.
16. non oppressus, ST 3 non est oppressus, F, and others. 17. ut non,
S. 19. suspiciendi, T. 20. aut illud adferant, aliquid esse, quod.
de his duobus habuerint compertum, de ceteris comperisse is the
reading of all good MSS. here, except that T omits illud. This must be
emended.

(i.) Leclerc suggested sese sor esse. Classen accepts this, so Bait. , Kl.

(ii.) Lambinus inserted nihil before comperisse: Graevius still better
non, which might easily be lost before the syllable com·, ‘oscitatione
