ἐ

’ a use of et, to attach the last member of a series without lending it any
emphasis, is not Ciceronian, except in the letters: ad Fam. xvi. 11. 3, f³

consulibus praetoribus tribunis plebis et nobis, qui pro coss. sumus
Sallust has it in the Jug. occasionally. 14. 88, ST and others ; est, R.

183.—-15. posset, almost all except ST. ab hoc, ST, Class., Ry. 3
adhuc, R, other edd. In the same line FM and others read esset,

and in consequence many edd. (but no MSS.) om. mementote: hoc after
8888, ST ; om. R. Taking first (a) the reading tametsi adhuc non esset Α

dictum : the sense is ‘ I can imagine what may be said (and could do so)
even although it had as yet not been said' 2 but we want veniret ; and, even
so, what does he gain by saying that he can imagine what may be said,
when the thing has been said? (b) tametsi adhuc non esse dictum
mementote (Kl.), or t. a. ιι. esse hoc d. m. (Bait.‚ Kays., Miill.): the
parenthesis now has some force, for the thing in question has not been
said before; and Cic. by this anticipation is cutting the ground from
under his adversaries' feet. (c) Still better, tametsi ab hoc non 8888 d.
m. (Class.‚ Ry.), t. ab hoc n. 8888 hoc d. m. (text): ab h0c=ab Accio.
Though Sassia had repeatedly made the statement during the question by
torture, her counsel had not availed himself of it (v, end os this section).
Ab lzoc is opposed to mz'lzz'. The corruption adhuc is easy of explanation z
abhoc, adhoc, adhuc. Also the presence of hoc twice in the sentence
explains its loss after 8888. 19. ei: hi, STF. So S in next line too.
23. 818, ST, om. R. utrum: verum, ST. 24. After Larini all
but ST give fuit. 27. an id. quod . . . dixisse : there is some variety of
reading here. dictitavit all MSS. but two: dictitabat, Lamb.‚ Or., Ry.
Stratonem . . . dixisse, ST, confirming conjecture of Schiitz: strato
. . . dixit, R. To the reading of ST, Madv. objects that there is nothing
to govern the infin. dixisse, and that the previous questions are in the form
of finite sentences (utrum furtum factum non est? cet.). He would there-
fore read cum id. vobis dicendum est quod. tum S. dictitavit cet.,
omitting quod and et. This is a Procrustean method of dealing with his
author. Why should all the questions necessarily have the same form?
Into this one a disturbing cause has entered—the verb dicendum esl—
which has taken over the government of the rest of the clause by a kind
of attraction, and the use of the infin. instead of the finite verb suggests
that a figment, not a fact, is under consideration.-—T has quaereret: act.
and pass. forms are sometimes confounded ε cp. ξ 83 n.
