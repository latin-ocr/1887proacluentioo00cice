182 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [L. 139

‘not only . . . but also . . . ' z'as in Greek ἄλλως τε καί . . . =‘ especially.’
Cp. Sest. §2, in quo cum multa sunt indigna, tum nihil minus est ferendum

. quam quod . . .‚ ‘ outrageous as this is in many other ways, the
most intolerable part of it is, that . . . ’ V. crit. n. on cum aliorum.
2. proinde quasi . . . dixerim: it must be observed that sentences of
comparison with quasi and tanquam follow the ordinary laws of sequence
of tenses, unless it is necessary to bring out the unreal character of the

supposed case: de Fz’n. v. ἓ 42, parvi primo ortu sic iacent, tanquam
omnino sine animo sint, contrasted with ad Fam. ii. 14. 1, eius negotium

sic velim suscipias, ut sz‘ esset res mea. So we may have the perf. (as
here) or the pluperf., in primary time. 5. populare, ‘generally
canvassed‚’ ‘in every one’s mouth,' equivalent to populariter agitatum
(v. infr.).

139.—6. neque cognitum commemoravi, ‘ did not found my remarks
upon any personal investigation.' 7. pro test. dixi: cp. ἓ 132, pro testi-
monio . . . laudat. temporis, ‘the exigencies of the time.’
Sometimes almost :periculum : Vatz'n. ἓ 2, 5ἰ in tanto hominis periculo et
tempori eius et voluntati parere voluissem3 Verr. i. ἓ 33, ex istius tem·
pore et causa, ‘to suit the exigencies of your client's case.' 10. offen-
siones, v. Glossary ; off. iudiciorum, ‘handles against the courts‚’ prep.
causes of offence given by the courts (subjective gen.). The plural of
abstraet substantives (especially those denoting mental affections) is used
to denote (a) the occasions of the exercise of the affection, e.g. laudes,
‘ praiseworthy deeds ' (lauszpraiseworthiness), formidines, amores (‘ the
beloved object, always plur.) libidines; (b) the expressions of the affection
in question, e. g dolores, gaudia(‘ expressions of pain, triumph' )‚ audaciae,
furores (‘ deeds of boldness, frenzy’ ). But often the plural of these verbs
is only intensive, as animi, spiritus, irae. We have another use again in
ς 56, conscientias facinorum, on which v. n. 12. sed errat vehemen-
ter, cet. This is the least skilsul part of Cicero’s defence. His previous ’
utterances were directly opposed to his present contention; they might be
got rid of in one of two ways· (a) by a timid line of defence—a partial
admission of their falsity. ‘An advocate is not speaking ex cathedra (as
a responsible statesman does) or on his oath as a witness. The exigencies
of the case and time determine his choice of facts. He is bound not to
say what he knows to be false 3 he is not bound only to say what he knows
to be true.’ In fact Cic. might admit that his utterances were ex re
causaquexlucta. (b) By a bolder line of defence z that of simple recanta-
tion. ‘On the question of fact I was wrong, I was misled: but 1· may
now claim credit for a mind open to reason, which 1 ask the jury to
exhibit.' In fact, Cic.’s utterances (he might say) were non cognita.
There can be little question that the latter (as Ry. says) was the only safe
line of apology. The former is double· edged: the jur,y if perversely
logical, might apply to the present speech the principle which they are
invited to apply to previous speeches. Y et Cic. adopts the former of the
