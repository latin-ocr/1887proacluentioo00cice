130 , EXPLANATORY NOTEs. [xxv. 69

After the battle of Cannae, the consul Varro was publicly thanked quod
de re publica non desperasset, Liv. xxii. 61. There is no uniform distinc-
tion in meaning between the accus, and dat. constructions: in the
former, the meaning is ‘to give up in despair‚' or ‘ give up hope of,’ and
this is preferred in phrases such as rem publicam, rei publicae statum,
desperare: ad Att. vii. 23. 2, causa publica desperata3 ib. § 3, desperata
res est. In the dat. construction, ‘to cease to hope for.’ hominem,
an emphatic eum. So ἓ 49, de homine3 ἓ 5ο, hominis. So Demosth.
constantly uses ὁ ἄνθρωπος of Philip in the Philzppics. Cp. ξ 184,
mulier.

69.—24. possit, pres. for imperf. for vividness' sake: v. crit. n. Cp. X(
R. 1785 subfin., r. 766 sub fin., R. 1789, r. 770 (several of the original
tenses are retained towards the end of the piece of Or. Obl. there given).
gravari . . . quod . . . se . . . timere dicebat: the language is pleo· ·
nastic ; gravari quod . . . timeret would be enough. (Gravari here means
‘to express his reluctance '). This is common in Cicero with verbs of
thinking and perceiving z de Or. ii. ἓ 22, saepe ex socero meo audivi cum
diceret3 Verr. ii. 4. 1, quaeretis quo id nomine appellandum putetis.
2 5. nobilissimis, v. Gloss nobilitas. invidiam atque offensionem,
popular ‘displeasure‚' one of Cicero’s duplicate phrases3 cp. regionis et
vicinitatis, ξ 11 ; mente et cogitatione, l. 30 below. For the use of
ac in such phrases cp. vi ac necessitate (ξ 19, with crit. n.). For the
meanings of ffrzszb, cffindo in this speech ν. Glossary. 27. ‘Came
down to a practicable demand.' Conficz'o prop. ‘to make up’ a sum of
money: Flacc. ξ 20, in aerario nihil habent civitates: duae rationes
conficiendae pecuniae, aut versura aut tributo. 30. impurissimus:
so Gabinius is called caenum ac labes amplissimi ordinis, and again leno ,
impurissimus, sest. ἓ 263 L. Gellius, a young rake‚ is called impurus
adulescens et petulans, z‘b. ἓ 1 10. It is a very strong term of abuse: thus
ad Att. ix. 12. 2, it is used with some temper of Dionysius, a friend who
had been false to Cicero, ‘a quo impurissime haec nostra fortuna
despecta est.' Modern taste is offended by the indiscriminating use of
such epithets in the ancient orators. (Sylvius weakens it here by explain-
ing it ‘avarz'ssz‘mus.') 31. Tr. in such cases by Or. Recta, according
to English idiom: ‘Nothing can suit my book better than the con-
demnation of O.'—a mercantile metaphor: cp. rationes putare, to settle
accounts.

XXVI.—-70. Pago 27, l. 8. miserrimisin locis et inanissimis, v. crit.
n. The plural is not easy to explain ; perhaps it lends vagueness to the
expression—⁶ where all was misery and penury.' Cp. n. on ἓ 31, l. 15,
iberos. For the apposition of z‘n with the abl. to the locative‚ cp. Albae
in urbe opportuna, Phil. iv. ἓ 6, R. 1167 (3), r. 487 c. 3. Observe that
nummi and other names of weights and measures take the gen. plur. in
-um only when in combination with numerals ε ag. tria millia nummum.
R. 365 a, r. 115 a. 9. malitia, ‘roguery':. cp. the phrase dolus
