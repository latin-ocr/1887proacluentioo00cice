tiaram auspices declarant, qui re omissa nornen tantum tenent.' Thus
at this time there was no actual taking of auspices. The old name sur-
vived: but the ‘auspex’ merely acted as witness to the signature of the
marriage settlement (tabulae legitimae). So Juvenal (Sat. x. 335), in
describing the preparations for the marriage of Messalina with Silius, has
the words—-
ritu decies centena dabuntur
antiquo, veniet cum signatoribus auspex,

and Suet. Claud. 26 on the same event: ‘quam cum comperisset C.
Silio etiam nupsisse dote inter auspices consignata supplicio adfecit.’ ¹
null-is auctoribus: ‘According to Roman law a woman was never
regarded as completely sui iuris. She was always in potestate parentis
or in manu vz‘rz' or z'n tutela. Hence, strictly speaking, she could perform
no legal act without the sanction of her husband or of her guardian, as
the case might be, ancl the person or persons who gave this sanction be-
came Auctor or Auctores of the transaction ': (Ramsay, ‘who quotes
Liv. xxxiv. 2, maiores nostri nullam, ne privatam quidem, rem agere
seminas sine auctore voluerunt : in manu esse parentum fratrum virorum).
So too a son subject to patria potestas cannot marry without an auctor,
who will be his father ε he must marry de consensu patris. Sest. ἕ 6, eo

the speaker seems to have been carried out of his course by the intensity
of his emotion.' 11. praeter hanc unam=praeter huius unius scelus,
