186 EXPLANATO RY NOTES. [LII. 143

ΙΙ. SECOND DIVISION oF THE CASE.—CLUENT1US wlLL NOT RELY

ΟΝ THE MERELY TECHNICAL DEFENCE WITH WHICH THE LETTER
OF THE LAW MIGHT SUPPLY HIM As AN EQUES. .

LII. 143.-Page 55, 1. 6. opinionem . . . quod existimaris: this
redundancy of expression is common in the case of verbs of thinking and
believing: so Verr. ii. 2. 185, cogitate . . . quid ex ceteris locis ex-
portatum putetis. Also § 150, infra, recusavit ne se putaret uti oportere.
Cp. Reid, Cic. Cat. M. ἓ 32. 15. ita defendisse . . . ut: cp. n. on
§ 49, 1. 20: ‘have I, think you, in defending the case, so much as
mentioned the law from beginning to end ? ' 17. ‘ As sar as man ought
to assert ’: thrown in to sosten the egotism of the assei-tion. Hominem
(L. and Sh. homo 1. B. b), ‘man as a fallible being' (Ρ.). Cp. quod
timide dicam, ξ 52. 18. istius invidiosi criminis: cp. n. on ista
multa iudicia, ἓ 88.

144—21. ntor instituto meo, ‘I am true to my habitual practice':
cp. ad Att. ii. 19. 3, ego neque pugno cum illa causa . . . neque approbo

.: utor via, ‘ I keep to the highroad.' Cp. also ἓ 199, vetere instituto,
‘ according to ancient practice.’ 23. consilio answers to prudentis:
voluntati to honesti, whichz‘respected, and therefore content to rest
his case upon its own merits, not upon legal questions.’ Cp. inter suos et
honesto et nobili, ἓ 11. 25. ad quas adhibemur, ‘ which we advocates
are retained to expound.’ 26. ‘ From the clause of the law which says,
“ whosoever shall have conspired to procure a verdict of guilty.”' The
reference is to the Sixth Chapter of the lex Cornelia de sicariis et venefi-
cis. As to the question whether Cluentius was actually impeached under ·
this chapter of the law, as well as under that which related to poisoning,
consult Introd.

145.——33. neque enim gives the reason, not for the fact stated (‘ 1 did
so ’), but sor the sact os its statement by Cic. Cp. ἓ 70, n. on nihil enim
est. Pago 56, l. 3. dignitatis z v, Gloss. 4. Quod sl nihil sqq.:
Ry. begins chapter liii. here: v, crit. n. 5. perorassem: v, Gloss.

LIII.—6. ma oratio . . . quod. ait Accius: cp. ἓ 143, opinionem
. . . quod existimaris, with n. 7. indignum facinus, ‘a monstrous
thing.’ Facinus in the sense of thing, ‘ circumstance‚' is common in Plaut.:
with indigyzum it appears sometimes, as a colloquialism, in Cic. not only
in letters (as ad Alt. ii. 13 init.) but in speeches ι Verr. ii. 5. 113 f. esse i.
plus mulieris apud te savia quam lacrimas matris valere ; Sest. ἓ 108, indig-
nissimum f. putavit illum . . . vivere ac spirare. So ἔργον, especially in
Hom„ who even calls a big stone μέγα ἔργον, Il. v. 303.

146.—9. Ut, concessive: R. 1706, r. 714 d. V. ἓ 150, ut . . . con·
fitear. 10. videro, ‘ used in all the persons to put off the consideration
of a question,’ leaving it to some one else (or one's-self) z as osten in Plaut.
and Ter„ there is little 'or no difference of meaning from the simple future.
