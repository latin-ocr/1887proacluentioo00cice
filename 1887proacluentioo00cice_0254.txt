where v. Prof. Palmer's n. 18. converte . . . non perferent ε a good
instance of co-ordination (paratactic construction) for subordination
(hypotactic). The latter would give us here a conditional sentence: si
convertes . . . non perferent. Cp. T usc. i. ξ 30, tolle hanc opinionem:
luctum sustuleris. Other paratactic forms are (a) that with the conditional

Sulla in the lex Cornelia de sicariis. Under this law C. Gracchus had
constituted a new quaestio. We need not (with Ry.) suppose this lex
Sempronia to have been passed before the transfer of iudicia to the equites,
It probably was directed mainly against the administrative jurisdiction of
the senate, by which that body at times, as in the case of the Bacchanalia,
might appoint an extraordinary commission to try offences os treason.
Momms. (Hist. Eng. tr. iii. p. 118) suggests t'hat it may have been
identical with the law de provocatione, which affirmed anew. the principle
of appeal to the people. Zumpt, again, supposes that this Sempronian
law, providing for the control of magistrates, was not confined to those
cases in which the penalty was capital ; the expression iudicio circumven-
iretur being perfectly general. He supposes Sulla to have adopted it with -
a limitation to capital cases (Crimz'nalrecht, ii. 2. 29-31). 30. adligare :
v. Gloss. 33. ‘ He would have concentrated in this single court all the
venom of his proscription as he wreaked it upon the former jurors.’
The law, as re-enacted by Sulla, dealt with judicial corruption, and still
applied to senatorial jurors only. Cicero says here that Sulla would have
made its action retrospective, or, in other words, extended its application
to the equites, had he dared to do so. proscriptionis: in which

order into the clutches of this statute.' In this and the two following
sections Cic. deals, as well as he can, with the very fair contention of Accius,
that all jurors (whether senators, knights, or tribuni aerarii) should be
ruled to be upon the same footing of legal responsibility. His reply may
be resolved into a positive argument (ἓ 152, beginning 0f§ 153) and a
negative argument (§§ 153, 154). (a) The positive argument is as follows:
1f a clause involving the equites were introduced it would be abused.
