as nomina engrere, ‘to call in one's debts': Hor. S. i. 2. 16, nomina
sectatur modo sumpta veste virili . . . tironum, of an avaricious usurer.

100.—18. 1110 iudicio ε the abl. of place where may be used without a
preposition occasionally (though far commonet in post-classical than in
classieal prose Latin) when it has an attribute, even though only a pro-
nominal one, as here. (We find the same qualification in the case of the
abl. of quality, of manner, and of time when.) So Sall. sug. 79, pleraque
Africa; Verr. ii. 2. 44, ceteras dicas omnis illo foro M. Postumius
quaestor sortitus est. Without an attribute it is only used in the case of
certain proper names, and of a few stereotyped local expressions, such as
terra, mari, via, loco: v. R. 1170 sqq„ r. 486 sqq. 19. P. cemimus:
thussnoticed, Brut. ἓ 271, P. Corn. Spoletinum, quo accusante defendi
C. Cornelium, in quo et compositum dicendi genus et acre et expeditum
fuit. We have a few fragments of Cicero's speech there referred to ; ac-
cording to Asconius (argumentum in or. pro C. Cornelio) the two Cominii
prosecuted Cornelius for maiestas, ‘detulit nomen Publius, subcripsit
Caius’: and the speech of P. Cominius, extant in his day, was worth
reading. 23. conciliandae gratiae, ἓ 84 ad init.

101.—25. persona: v, Gloss. We have the converse phrase in Caec.
514, quam personam iam e cotidiana vita cognoscitis . . . mulierum
adsentatoris . . . hanc personam imponite Aebutio. 26. ad Iuturnae:
the ellipse as in Horace’s ‘ ventum erat ad Vestae! An Italian goddess,
sister of Turnus, to whom springs were sacred, especially the spring
Iuturna, near the Numicus, from which water was brought to Rome for
sacrificial purposes3 nympha decus fluviorum, Verg. A. xii. 142. Q.
Lutatius Catulus first built here a temple near the Aqua Virgo in the
Campus Martius (SerV. Verg. A. xii. 1393 also Ov. Fasti, i. 463, quoted
by Ry.: Te quoque lux eadem, Turni soror, aede recepit, Ι hic ubi Virginea
campus obitur aqua). 27. Exagitabantur . . . probabatur: avery artistic
sentence. The arrangement of the first two members (exag. . . . fallaciae,
tota . . . aperiebatur) is chiastie : then follows anaphora (the symmetrical
arrangement of words in positions exactly corresponding 3 here in the
sequence subst., attribute, verb). Cp. n. on ξ 83, 1. 26. Exagita-
bantur, ‘ were ferreted out.' A hunting metaphor‚ which appears in the
use of agite, ‘ to hunt down,' ἓ 82. (In ἓξ 4, 88, however, it has the mean-
ing ‘ to discuss‚' ‘turn over.') So de Off iii. ἓ 68, tendere plagas etiam si
excitaturus non sis nec agitaturus, ‘though you do not intend either to
start the quarry from its lair or to hunt it ;’ ad Att. i. 16. 8, insectandis
exagitandisque nummariis iudicibus. Exagitozexcito, ‘ to hunt out. ’ V.
Gloss. agito. 28. ratione : ν. Gloss. 29. in medium : n. on ἓ 77,
l. 10. 30. interpres ε v. Gloss. and refer to ad Att. l.c. on 1. 27 supr.
probabatur: v. Gloss.

102.—Quam ob rem . . . confirmem Cicero’s argument again takes
refuge in sonorousobscurity. To apprehend it we must notice that cum
ita . . . Oppianicus is a parenthesis, and relates to what follows, not what
