quest of Niebuhr. It is written on large parchment in a beautiful hand,
and belongs to the fifteenth century. Halm has since collated it.

T (Classen's B), in the Laurentian library at Florence. Collated first
by Lagomarsini, 1748. Niebuhr pointed out to Classen the importance
of its variations from the Vulgate, and this led the latter to make in-
’ quiries leading to the discovery of Ms. from which it differs for the worse
in flaws and omissions.

P (Classen’s C), the Turin palimpsest, was discovered by Peyron in
the Royal Library at Turin, superscribed with a work of St. Augustine. It
consists of 56 leaves of parchment, and contains fragments of ten speeches
and of the Ep. ad Fam. Twelve of these leaves belong to the Cluentiana.

· It is‘probably of no later date than the fifth or sixth century. Classen

found that it sometimes confirmed T, where no other MS. did so. The

parts of the speech for which we have it are always exactly noted below ;
roughly they are—

§§ 1-7 ἐξ 92·94
18-24 101-103
32-38 129-131
74-78 145·147·

Stray confirmations of the text of ST may be found elsewhere ; in the
references which we have to the Codex S. Victoris in older commentators
(Sylvius, Lambinus probably, and Gulielmus, who collated it), to the
eight Palatine MSS. by Gruter, to the two Codd. Francii by Graevius.
Of these the first-named Codex seems to have been the most valuable.

¹ 1 have also thought it worth while to note the corrections by a second
hand in b, described by Classen as ‘ Cod. S. Marci, n. 106, Lagomarsinii 6,
chartaceus.'· They represent an early emendation of the Vulgate recen-
sion from the better recension, and are a testimony to the latter of some
value.1

Besides these MSS. there are others less authoritative‚ and representing
on the whole the Vulgate recension. These are—

F (Classen’s d), fifteenth century, parchment: described by Class. as
Lagomarsinii 1, formerly in the Library of St. Bartholomew at Fiesole.
Without lacunae.

M (Classen's p), eleventh century, parchment 3 Lagomarsinii 64, in
Longobardic characters z in the Laurentian Library. Has lacunae.

Miiller refers to another MS. which he describes as Cod. Helmstad.
n. 304. Its readings are to be found in Wrampelmeyer (Progr. Clausthal‚
1881), and are generally those of FM. Ι have referred to it occasionally
as W.

The quotations in Quintilian and the grammarians, which are numerous,
will be found worthy of attention (v. especially ἓξ 15, 32, 166, 167).

In the notes which follow I have attempted almost nothing in the way
