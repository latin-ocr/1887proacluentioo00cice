CH· VI· There was a scandal which grieved Cluentius, but (ἓ 16)
he could only disown Sassia.

(ἓ 17) It grieves me that his defence should be an attack
on his mother ; but from this sprang a feud between
them, (ἓ 18) and she has been at the bottom of all
his troubles ever since, and is now maintaining this
prosecution. Silence about her is impossible.

VII. (ἓ 19) Let me take one by one the grounds of Oppianicus'
conviction. First, Cluentius was driven to prosecute
(ἓ 2ο) by an attempt on his own life by poison. The
case was so clear that Oppianicus had need of Staienus⁷
help. (ἐξ 21, 22) Dinaea, whose daughter married
Oppianicus, and bore him the present prosecutor,
young Oppianicus, left a will, of which the latter was
heres: a son, who was then a slave in Gaul after the
Social War, was to have a legacy of 400,000 sesterces,
VIII. should he be discovered. (ἕ 23) But Oppianicus, the
father, got M. Aurius put out of the way, and suborned
the person who had informed Dinaea of her son's
being still alive, to conceal his whereabouts. (ἕ 24) Α.
Aurius of the same family charging him with these
two crimes, he fied to Q. Metellus' camp, and after-
wards (ἓ 25) returning in Sulla's time to Larinum,
made himself and three others municipes, and put to
death A. Aurius, Sassia's husband, Aurius Melinus, a
son of A. Aurius, and a tool of his own in his former
crime, Sex, Vibius.

IX. (ξ 26) Next he fell in love with Sassia, and as her objec-
tion to him was that he had three sons, (ξ 27) he
summoned home from a distance one by a divorced
wife, whereon the boy shortly died under suspicious
circumstances, and then (ξ 28) he murdered the
second [the third, young Oppianicus, as Dinaea's
heres, was worth preserving] and married Sassia.

X, (ξ 29) Judge by your own indignation now, what must
have been the feelings of the jury when he was tried.
Conviction was certain, and bribery needless.

(ξ 3ο) But more: he murdered his wife Cluentia, my
client's aunt, Auria his brother Caius' wife, at a
time when she was with child, and then his brother
