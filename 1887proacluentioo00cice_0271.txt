‘in weight '). When libras was omitted, pondo came to be treated as an
indeclinable subst. meaning ‘pounds 'z ag. in Pl. Asin. 279, quot
pondo ted esse censes nudum, it is gen. R. 1209 n. 4 (r. 497).
puero non grandi: cp. n. on ἓ 176 as to the vagueness of puer,
whence the need for an epithet. Grandis, ‘grown up' : ἓ 11, grandem et
nubilem filiam.

18o.——12. non comparebant, ‘were not forthcoming': cp. n. on
apparere, 5 147. 13. For the asyndetic style of this narrative cp. n.
on ἓ 58. 16. ‘ That he had lately seen among the sundries for sale at
an auction, a fine saw, curved in shape‚ crooked, and with teeth on every
edge.' A singular tool : but for that very reason, valuable in supplying
circumstantial evidence: it had left its own mark in the bottom of the
chest. However, Mr. Davies reads ‘ aduncam ex omni parte serrulam ' :
and supposes Cic. to have mixed up in his description the action of two
tools, both indispensable: the brace-and-bit and the saW. The former
bores the hole to start from3 it consists of a bow-shaped frame, on the
top of which one hand is placed, while the other hand, holding it in the
middle, revolves it round the bit (as axis), which fits into the lower end of
it. The bit has two teeth curving outwards on either side of the diameter 3
and this, according to Mr. Davies, is the reference of aduncam, while
ex omni parte is ‘ sheer ignorance ’ on Cic. ’s part. [The brace-and-bit is
not mentioned in Bliimner's T eclmologie.—H. J. R.]

here the latter. Ry. reminds us that this occupatiori was that of the
father of Horace ε

nec timuit, sibi ne vitio quis verteret, olim
si praeco parvas aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor
mercedes sequerer. (S. i. 6. 86.)

21. According to Donatus, indicat is qui de se volens aliquid et de aliis
etiam prodit: sed confitetur qui de se tantum, et qui invitus (ad Ter.
Adelplz. prol. 5). For a spontaneous confession as to oneself the
strongest word is pmfiteor: Caec. ἓ 24, confitetur, atque ita libenter con-
fitetur, ut non solum fateri, sed etiam profiteri videatur.

181.——25. Anhere is almostznum: it introduces the second of two
alternatives, the first of which is implied in quid quisquam . . . potest?
‘ Am I right in saying that no one could suspect anything else ? or will
you say . . . ?' Cp. §65‚ quid reticetis? an negare non potestis quod
repetistis? where, however, an almost=nonne: cp. ἓ 99, note on nescio
