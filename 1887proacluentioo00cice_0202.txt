138 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xxrx. 80

on §9, l. 9. 3. Cp. reference from Verr. i. § 2 (quoted §61, l. 14)
as to the agitation of Quinctius and others before the passing of the
lex Aurelia. m-hanc flammam . . . iniectum3 cp. the Greek pro-
verb, employed by Plato (Rep. 569 C), τὸν καπνὸν φεύγοντα εἰς τὸ πῦρ
ἐκπίπτειν, and Liv. xxii. 40. 3, se populare incendium priore consulatu
semustum effugisse. 4. esse lnieetum memini. Memini (a present-
perfect, meaning properly ‘ I have taken to my mind,' ‘ I bear in memory')
takes a pres. inf. or a perf. inf. : in the former case it is implied that the
subject was an eye—witness of the fact which he remembers. In the
latter case this may be so, but is not of necessity implied. The pres.
inf. implies the continuance of the action up to the time when it was
‘taken into the mind.' (Cp. the construction with cum ι memini cum ita
diceret.) Cp. Lael. §11, memini Catonem . . . mecum et cum Scipione
disserere3 on the other hand, Rosc. Am. ἓ 122, meministis me ita initio
distribuisse causam, where, had Cicero wished to emphasise the fact that
the jurors had witnessed the fact, he would have said distribuere. Cp.
Cluent. ξ 32, memoria teneo Milesiam quandam mulierem . . . rei capi—
talis esse damnatam. So in the ex. before us ε the present-perfect force
of memini is not felt3 it is a present, and the action is simply recalled
as one that took place in past time. V. Mr. Reid’s admirable note on
Lael. ἓ 2, in connection with R. 1372, r. 543, 4 (also Madv. 408. 2).
5. ‘Already marked out by public opinion for the praetorship.’ hominem

80.—8. Neque me paenitet, ‘I am not sorry,’ ‘dissatisfied,’ a common
meaning of the word ε Liv. i. 8. 3, me haud paenitet eorum sententiae esse,
‘I am quite satisfied to be of their opinion ’; Plaut. er’n. 321, is probus
est quem paenitet quam probus sit; de Off. i. ἓ 2, quoad te quantum proficias
non paenitebit. On Verg. E. ii. 33, Servius explains paeniteat by ‘ parum
videatur.’ 9. ‘ His case remains the same in its absolute unchangeable-
ness’ (R). The indic. potest states the fact as unconditioned and abso-

lute. 12. nunc, cp. n. on ἕ 120. 13. quorum=penes quos, R.‘‡ ’Δ

1282, r. 517. 15. tum si dicerem non audirer ε refer to ς 63, l. 21, for
this use of the imperf. subj. to denote continuous action unfulfilled (i.e.
supposed contrary to fact to exist) in past time. ‘ Not that the case
was different,' not (as P.) ‘ would have been.' Subj. of the untrue reason,
- R. 1744, r. 740.
