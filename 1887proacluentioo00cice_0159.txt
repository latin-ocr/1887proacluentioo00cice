VJ. 17] EXPLANATORY NOTEs. 95

stituted for ut non, but only when the consequence vanishes into an ex-
planation. The Grammars do not assign sufficient prominence to this oc·
casional force of ut (and ut non). Cp. the exx. in Zumpt, ἓ 623 3 which
are there explained as consecutive, depending on the idea of happenz‘ng
in the principal verb: novum est, rarum, naturale, necesse, usitatum,
mirum, singulare est, non veri simile est, etc., are all used with ut, which
should be called explanatory, and frequently is anticipated by a neuter
pronoun hoc illud etc. ; Dz’v. z'n Caec„ ἓ 23, solum id est, ut me Siculi
velint.—-In Rosc. Am. §20, hoc z'la est utile, ut ne plane inludamur ab
accusatoribus, the ztt ne is equivalent to ut non, and explanatory (of ita)
rather than final (R. 1636, 1638, r. 682 a) ; and so in many cases in which
ut, preceded by ita or not, gives a restriction. V. R. 1650, 1704, r. 682,
684, 714.1 [On Cic. Fz'n. ii. ἓ 24, v, R. 1700. A result may be spoken
of as simply a resulting fact, or as a purposed result. In some forms os
expression either ue or non is applicable. I should express Cicero’s use
of the two in some such way as this, ‘ The result is not to make pleasure
cease to be pleasure, but to show that pleasure is not the highest good.’-——

17.—31. communibus hominum sensibus: ‘de Orat. iii. 195, ea
sunt in communibus infixa sensibus. V. Munro on Lucr. i. 422'
(H. N. ap. P.): used both in Sing. and Plur. ε (1) ‘the sense or
instinct given by nature to all sane men.' (2) A distinct meaning is
‘the socz‘al sense '—an ‘acquired feeling of the common duties and
proprieties expected from each member of society) A good ex. of
this is Sen. Ep. Mor. i. 5. 4, 1100 primum philosophia promittit, sensum
communem, humanitatem et congregationem. Hor. Sat. i. 3. 65,
sorte legentem Ι aut taciturn impellat quovis sermone molestus: Ι ‘com-
mum‘ sensu plane caret,’ inquimus ε where Prof. Palmer tr. ‘ordi-
nary tact.' In neither sense should it be translated ‘common sense.’²
31. atque ln ipsa natura, not ‘the natural constitution ofman’ necessarily.
Cic. often couples natura rerum with communis sensus : de clamo 97, in- .
fitiari me esse hominem et communem naturae sensum repudiare ε de Fz'n.
4. 55, sensus cuiusque et natura rerum atque ipsa veritas: as we
might say ‘ a law of human nature—nay‚ a law of the universe itself.’
Tr. ‘a principle which has its roots deep in the common feelings of
humanity and in fact in the very laws of Nature.’ V. crit. n. 32. iu
takes up lcoc : cp. ξ 137, where id is resumed by id: and n. on ἓ 7, l. 15.
33. qui . . . adiungerer : ‘ who am retained sor the defence of those im-
perilled by actions at law.' (P.) The tense is due to the attraction os
si . . . viderem. Cp. pro Sall. ξ 35, si Torquatus Sullam solum accusasset.
ego quoque hoc tempore nihil aliud agerem, nisi eum qui accusatus esset

1 On this subject consult especially Mr. Reid on Sull. ξ 27 (and his promised note on
Fin. ii. ἓ 15) ; also v. Madv. ξ 456. 4, Drag. 411, 542, 562.

Β Aristotle’s κοινὴ αἴσθησις-1110 central sense of the special sensations—is not to be
confounded with this (v. wallace, Outlines, ξ 44).
