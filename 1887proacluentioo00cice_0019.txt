INTRODUCTION. xi

and counterplots, a coherent narrative with a dramatic unity
of its own3 in which the innocent Cluentius is the suffering
hero, while Sassia his unnatural mother, and Oppianicus his
stepfather, take the second and third νόίε respectively in the
drama of his sorrows. But we also recognise in the dark
portrait of Oppianicus the work of the master-hand which
afterwards limned the features of Catiline3 and in fact a
series of vivid pictures, often drawn in a few strong touches,
passes before our eyes: the fearless Aurius denouncing the
murderer of his kinsman in the crowded market-place of
Larinum: the weak-headed profligate Asuvius and his
traitorous friend : the travelling quack L. Clodius, who made
short work of his patients when he was in a hurry, but was
always successful in his own peculiar treatment: Ambivius,
the innkeeper of the Latin Way: ‘Doctor’ Strato: and
several others.

The course of the speech is enlivened with frequent
narrative, in which humour and pathos are skilfully blended
with the argument which the advocate wishes to drive home.
Thus when he is describing the trial of Scamander, the ac-
complice of Oppianicus, whom he had himself defended, he
diverts the jury—in the literal sense of the word—by a playful
'account of his youthful nervousness as he rose to speak, the
shift's to which he was reduced in such a desperate case, and
the ease with which the counsel for the prosecution disposed
of them. While we laugh, we forget to criticise. Comparing
this passage with a similar one in Rosc. Am. ἓξ 59, 60, we
seem to see in it a finish and force and verva which is wanting
in the earlier narrative: this is due to the more successful
application of the asyndetic style. The superb narration
of the, trial of Oppianicus requires no praise: Staienus,
conscript father, briefless barrister‚ and law—court jobber,
gloating over the hoarded gold which was not yet his own,
and with a stroke of genius devising means to make it so·,
Bulbus and Gutta, his dupes, the worthy pair over whose
names (‘ Messrs. Onion and Cruet') Cicero makes so merry,
and the final confusion of counsels among honest men. Even
if Cicero is romancing, it is perhaps a case in which fiction
gives us a better insight into the spirit of the times than
truth would have done.

Again, the historical illustrations, such as the episodes of
the review of P. Africanus the censor (1ηὲ 134), and of the
altercation of Brutus and Crassus (in §g 140, 141), remind
