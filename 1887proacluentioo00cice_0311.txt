latter, each with an asterisk after iudicandam3 cod. S. Vict. had

pecuniam quam St„ qui causam nusquam eadem 1. d.: explaining
‘though acquitted, Falcula no less than St. might have received a bribe,
ob rem iud. ; Staienus, however, was never accused for having received
such a bribe.' Ravius’ emendation (adopted by Klotz), iudicandam
pecuniam qua capta nusquam st. eadem 1. d. is nearer to the MSS„
but harsher in expression. The reading adopted in the text is taken
from Madvig, Adversaria, iii. p. 127. There cannot be much doubt
about the general sense of the passage. It is as follows :—

Falcula was brought to trial twice: on the first occasion, for having
acted informally as juror on the trial of Opp. : this time he was acquitted
at the first hearing. ‘ I waive this first acquittal‚' Cicero says ε ‘that he
was cleared upon that count is no proof, I admit, of his innocence of the
other charge (pecuniae ob rem iud. captae). [Then what of the second
trial of Falcula? It is important, for] Staienus was not tried on the
direct issue of judicial corruption, of which the court which tried him
(maiestatis) had no cognisance. But Falcula was thus tried: and was
triumphantly acquitted.

Taking the reading of F, the corruption must be localised at captam
nusquam. The supposed transition (at nusquam) srom the first trial
of Falcula to the second (expressed in the above paraphrase by the words
in brackets), is one impossible in any argument intended to be intelligible.
We may do one of three things : (i.) make the best of the reading which
F supplies. Ry. does this, punctuating and supplementing thus—
accepisse tamen ob rem iud. captam. Nusquam, cet. ‘ Even although
he may not have been guilty of the offence with which he was
first charged, . . . it is still very possible that he may have received
a bribe in his capacity of a juror. Staienus, upon whose conviction
so much stress has been laid, was nowhere impeached under the same
law (eadem lege) as Falcula [on lais second trz'al].' The objections to
this are: (a) the impossible transition aforesaid; (b) the tautological
