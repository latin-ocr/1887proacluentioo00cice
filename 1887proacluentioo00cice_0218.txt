154 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xxxvn. 103

precedes it. The protasis of the sentence (si . . . ablata est) consists of two
arguments, both dependent on sl, the first giving the prior condition, the
second the later condition which clenches it—the first gives indirect‚ the
second direct, proof of the guilt of Opp. The sentence may thus be sum-
marised: (i.) The verdict against Staienus (indirectly) asserted Opp.'s
guilt (and you must remember that we agreed that either Cluentius or Opp.
must have bribed) ; (ii.) and while I defy you to prove anything against
Cluentius, there is direct evidence of a damning kind against Opp.—his
recovery of bribe-money from Staienus by law. leerefore Staienus’ con-
demnation, sar from telling against Cluent., is strong evidence fhr him.
The parts of the protasis are related to the conclusion in the same way as
they would be if si were repeated before cum: cp. n. on ἓ 6, l. 30. The
sentences Cluenti . . . reperietur, Oppianici . . . ablata est are in an ad-
versative asyndeton (the unexpressed connection is ‘ but,' not ‘ and’). In
Greek we should have μέν and δέ. On the worth of the latter of the two
arguments cp. n. on ἓ 64. Pago 39, 1. 5. post mucium, se.
Oppianici: cp. ἓ 78.

XXXVII. 103.—9. video, ‘I find’: cp. ξ 119, n. 12. si . . .
appellet . . . confiteatur necesse est: the form of the conditional
sentence is irregular: in the apodosis the assertion of necessity is made
independently of the condition (n. est instead of n. sit). The form for
an imaginary condition is preferred because the condition si appellet has in
effect just been negatived—potz'us quam iud. appellandum putem. Cp.
div. in Caec. §21, cur nolint, etiam si taceant, satis dicunt: verum non
tacent. R. 1574 (1), r. 654 (1) 3 Madv. 348, 361, obs. 2. [I con-
sider sz' appellet to qualify confiteatur (R. 1778), necesse est being as it were
over the whole conditional sentence, both apodosis and protasis.—

English ‘that of Bulbus.' The demonstr. pron. cannot be used as the
Greek article, either with a gen. (τὸ τοῦ δεῖνος) or with a part. (illi iudi-
cantes=c³1<e2voc δικάζοντες, not οἱ δικάζοντες). Bradl. Arn. ἓ 73. When
(about the 5th cent. A.D.) the six cases of Latin were reduced to two, the
demonstrative force of ille was weakened: it became an article: ag.
‘ dicebat ille teloneus de z‘llo mercado ad'z‘llos necuciantes ' (7th cent.), ‘ the
custom-house officer spoke about the merchandise to the traders.' Hence
the French le, la, les· (Brachet, Hz‘st. Fr. Gramm. lib. ii. pt. i. ch. 2).
