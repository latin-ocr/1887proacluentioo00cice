or, more simply, by refusing in his deep grief to appear on the side of

The witness stands while his deposition is being read. There seems
to have been nothing like cross-examination by the counselr for the other
side. Probably Cic. had obtained leave to have the elder Balbutius’s
evidence given in writing on the plea of his prostration by sorrow: his
real reason may have been that the old man was less likely to contradict
himself thus than if he spoke in open court. V. Ry. R. Ant. p. 298, on
tabulae or written evidence, and cp. the reading of the laudatio, ξ 196

LXI.—169.—19. conflatum: V. n. on ξ 9, quid invidia conflarit. Here
the word is used in the first of the two metaphorical senses there men-
tioned—‘ to work up.' ‘ In it all the moving spirit has been his mother.’
25. aut quod metuunt aut quod oderunt: ep. the often quoted ‘ oderint
dum metuant ’ (e. g. Sest. ἓ 102), a favourite saying of the emperor Caligula.

170.—26. Cp. n. at beginning of ἓ 167. There is a great similarity of
argument. 30. exsulis testimonio: ‘an exsul was ipso facto in-
capable of giving evidence—he was civilly dead‚’ Ry. The exile was
capite deminutus. Cp. ξ 201 n. 33. damnati, cet.: the genitive
depends on illam3 the words are kept for the end of the sentence
(instead of being connected with quam ille vivebat), because they thus
convey the reason why the life of Opp. was not worth living. Pago 66,
l. 1. animi importumtatem, ‘his misbegotten temper 'z importunus
denoting something unnatural and portentous3 here, the character of
one who murdered wife and children. In de Fz‘n. i. ἓ 35 (nollem me ab
eo ortum tam importuno tamque crudeli) it refers to Manlius, who
executed his own son. V. Gloss. recipere tecto: simple local
abl„ the place being the means: Liv. xxvi. 25, ne quis urbe tecto mensa
lare reciperet. We find also domum, z'n civitatem, recipere, R. 1174,
1177, r. 489. It is a mistake to say that recipere never means to receive.
It frequently means ‘receive ’ in the sense of giving shelter to: Plane.

171.—5. quod: this attraction of the relative is very common. The
attraction of the demonstrative is very similar: ἓ 34, si haec solutio
legatorum est, note. R. 1068, r. 451. '6. perfugium calamitatis,
‘retreat from missortune.' For the gen. cp.§ 1, invidia iudicii, note.
6. animi, ‘spirit.' The ancients did not hold that the suicide is

necessarily a coward: witness their untiring praise of ‘Cato's glorious ’

death ' (Hor. C. i. 12. 35). There was nothing in the ethics of the day
answering to the Christian view of the sacredness of life. The Stoics
allowed the wise man a εὔλογος ἐξαγωγή, or rational retirement from the
