bring a man to his death: and also (possibly) with other
acts committed with the same intent.1

The Fifth Chapter, under which Cluentius was primarily
accused‚ related to those who had aided and abetted poisoning
by supplying the means.2 Compare with this Chapter 1. of
the same law.

Lastly‚ the Sixth Chapter (incorporating, as we have seen,
the law of C. Gracchus) dealt with what we may call judicial
murder, and applied to all who should have conspired or
combined to procure the condemnation in court of an in-
nocent man, or should (acting in the capacity of judge or
juror) have received a bribe for that purpose (the reference
is doubtless to misconduct in criminal, not civil courts). And
the peculiarity of this last chapter was that its application was
restricted to those who had a seat in the senate, or held
or had held a magistracy by choice of the people. Of the
existence of this restriction there is ample evidence.3

§4 The question now arises: Was Cluentius a Roman
Knight expressly accused under the sixth chapter of the lex
Cornelia de sicariis?

It is certain that whether he was so accused or not, Cicero
intended to convey the impression that he was, and a whole
section of the speech (ἓὲ 143-16o> is devoted to a technical
defence, which, 'at the same time, he ostentatiously, in defer·
ence„forsooth, to the wishes of his client, waives his right to
make.

We must however be on our guard against an implicit

ng. xlviii. 8. Ι). Probably Cicero is speaking correctly for his own
period, and the jurists of the Digest speak of the lex Cornelia as it was
modified in imperial times. This hypothesis is rendered likely by the
context in the Digest, which speaks of deportatio (an imperial punishment)
as the penalty threatened. The original penalty under the law was
‘ aquae et ignis interdictio.'

1 Lex Cornelia poenam deportationis infligit ei qui hominem occiderit
eiusve rei causa furtive faciendi cum telo fuerit et qui venenum hominis
necandi causa habuerit vendiderit paraverit falsumve testimonium dixerit,
qup quisgperiret‚ mortisve causam praestiterit (Paul. Sent. rec. v. 23. 1).
⁸ 3 {thare-xtra& in the Digest from Marcian (Dig. xlviii. 8. ι) gives the
general meaning of this part of the law (altered to suit the time of
Justinian): ‘quive, curn magistratus esset publicove iudicio praeesset,
operam dedisset, quo quis falsum iudicium profiteretur, ut innocens
circumveniretur, condemnaretur. Praeterea tenetur qui . . . salsum testi-
monium dolo malo dixerit quo quis publico iudicio rei capitalis damnaretur3

quive magistratus iudexve quaestionis ob capitalem causam pecuniam
acceperit, ut publica lege reus fieret. ²
