23. calumniam non effugiet = calumniae iudicium non effugiet. (V.
Gloss. on calumnia.) ‘ Believe me, the said civil action must involve
him in the criminal penalties of calumny, even though he too will per-
haps enjoy the advantage of your able advocacy.’ It must be remembered
that calumnia was a iudicium publicum: thus Cic. implies that Ennius,
like Shylock in the Duke’s Court, would find the tables turned upon him.
From being claimant in a civil suit, he is to become defendant in a criminal
trial. 24. hominem multorum hospitum: for the gen. v. crit. n.
‘ That man of hospitality, Ambivius, the innkeeper of the Latin Way.’
The Via Latina ran through Latium as far as Beneventum in Samnium,
where it joined the Via Appia. Cp. ἓ 192. 27. ‘ It is still unnecessary,'
i.e. ‘at present it is unnecessary to speak.' 28. Si invitaverit . . .
decessisse: it is not easy either to translate or to explain this play upon
words. Ry. and P. both say that travellers were said decedere de via
when they turned in to an inn by the roadside, upon what authority I do
not know; devertere is ‘to turn in ’ or ‘ put up at’ a place, and also ad·
mits of being used metaphorically (v, L. and Sh.). Why then did not
Cic. say devertisse? However, upon that view we should tr. ‘ If he gives
us an invitation, we shall entertain him in such a way that he will regret
ever having left the high-road. ' But de via decedere has only one meaning,
‘to go out of the way,' and with the dat. ‘to make way for': cp. the
famous ‘ salutari appeti decedi assurgi‚’ de Senect. ξ 63. And it is as lzost
still that Ambivius de via decedit: this is far more probable than his
sudden conversion into guest or traveller. So Sylvius rightly explains
‘ caupones ut hospites invitent, de via non numquam decedunt) ‘ If he
gives us his professional invitation, we shall give him such a warm recep·
tion that he will rue the day he left lzis Road ' or ‘ went out of the Way for
us.' Of Ambivius as accuser, the expression means ‘ left the Latin Way
for Rome': of Ambivius, as landlord, ‘made way for us to enter his
house‚' or perhaps ‘ went out of his way to ask us in.' In fact there is a
pun on via. Similar is the expression de Fz'n. v, ξ 5, paullum ad
dexteram de via declinavi, ut ad Pericli sepulchrum accederem.

164.—31. meditati, ‘after eight years' preparation.’ Not a pass. part„
‘schooled‚' which, applied to a person, is found only in Plaut. eg. adules—
centem meditatum probe, Trin. iii. 3. 88. 32. ‘Frivolous in actual
character, unfounded in fact, briefly refuted.' A curious use of brevia ε it
is the answers to the charges, not the charges, that are short. The abl.
(supine) is abl. of the ‘thing in point of which‚’ as are genere, re: but
those are necessary attributes, this is an accident. The expression will
as little bear analysis as will that of the board-school essayist who said that
⁶ pins have saved thousands oft lives ' ,and explained, ‘ by not swallowing
them.» ast( lq‘fl, lffi‘l . ι Maefi‘k
