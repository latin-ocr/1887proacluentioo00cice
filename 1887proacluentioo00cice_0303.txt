byKGraevius, inanissimus being explained as pauperrimus, ‘ vacuus yiator,'
Juv. x. 22, being compared. Class. objects to each of the latter readings,
saying that miserrimis as an epithet does not suit locis, nor inanissima&
Staienus: he fixes the error at et, and writes miserrimus in locis [et]
inanissimis, for et would naturally be inserted when miserrimus was
changed to -is. (But how is the reading of T to be accounted for in that
case ?) Class. however offers a conjecture : miserrimus in locis exinani-
tissimis (this word occurs Verr. ii. 5. 104, leg. agr. ii.§ 72). Ernesti
conjectures loculis, and Kays., adopting it, conjectures and writes,
’ miserrimus in loculis ante inanissimis. This is a somewhat violent
remedy. [Y et it retains miserrimus, which is well authenticated, and rids
us of the dubious plural locis, as to which v. explan. n. If we were to
read miserrimus olim loculis inanissimis, it would be easy to deduce the
variants from this original, and miserrimus would have its necessary
qualification in point of time—‘once so wretched.'] It is no doubt
strange that the reading of S, so simple, should have been thus perverted
in the MSS. 3 the termination of the adj. miserrimis was perhaps confused
with the nom. terminations of the adjectives preceding : perhaps also the
apposition of m. in locis to domi suae was misunderstood by the scribe.
The further progress of corruption is clear : miserrimis becoming
miserrimus, ‘then inanissimis was altered to agree with it, and finally in
locis was left out to make sense of the corrupted words,’ Ry. (For the
