XXI. 59] EXPLANATORY NoTEs. 123

copiarum datum, quia L. Manlius praetor et zpse cum haud invalido prae-
sidio in Galliam mittebatur, ‘ Manlius was being sent as well (as
Cornelius) ’ 3 i. preface ἓ 3, iuvabit tamen rerum gestarum memoriae
principis terrarum populi pro virili parte et ipsum consuluisse, ‘ I shall be
glad to have done my part (as well as others) for Roman history.' In
each case the words in question are equivalent to a very strong etiam—Et
ipse (according to Merguet) only occurs once in Cic., Rosc. Am. ἓ 48, qui
et ipsi incensi sunt studio, and the best interpreters now disconnect et from
ipse in that passage. Ipse quoque is generally used in its place ε Sex Rosc.
ἓ 33, hominem . . . nisi inter eos, qui ipsi quoque insaniunt, insanissimum.
Here we have etiam ipse, ‘ he proceeded gratuitously to inflict fresh gashes
upon a case that was maimed and wounded at the outset ’ ε etiam zpsc= ‘ on
his part too,' ‘ as well as the accuserS.' Cp. Planc. ἓ 85, uter nostrum est
cupidior ioci? egone, qui quod dici potuit non dixerim, an tu qui etiam
zpse in te dixeris? ‘ which of us is fonder of a joke? I, for having missed
an opportunity, or you for having gratuitously made one on yourself?’
ut: v. crit. n. for an important variant. 12. sedulo faciebat:

v, crit. n. and Glossary, 13. praevaricari accusationi, ‘to be in 2917}

lusi—qn with the prosecution.' V. crit.. n. here: this dative constructimi'
is without a parallel z it may be justified as a dat. commodi, but we should
rather expect accusatori. Strictly speaking, the word is improperly used
here. It should signffy, of the prosecutor, ‘to make terms with the de-
sence’ from corrupt motives, instead of prosecuting in earnest. Cp.
Plin. Ep. i. 20, praev. et transire dicenda; v. Glossary, praevaricari.
14. ‘ From the secrets of his stock-in—trade,'——P.; artificium is technical
skill or knowledge. So Dz'v. in Caec. 543, after similarly ridiculing the con—
ventionalities of an antagonist's style, he says, ‘ nunquam ille me opprimet
consilio, nunquam ullo artificio pervertet, nunquam ingenio me suo labe-
factare atque infirmare conabitur.' 15. This repetition of the same word
at the beginning of the sentence was called ἐπαναφορά, ‘repetitio,' in
rhetorical treatises, eg. Cornif. iv, ἓ 19. In Dz'v. in Caec. Cic. similarly
derides the stock rhetoric of the day, and its favourite exordia, ‘Iovem
ego opt. maX.' and ‘ vellem, si fieri potuisset, iudices.'

59. With this historic infin. in animated narration (not very common “
in Cic.)‚ cp. Verr. ii. 4. 66, rex primo nihil metuere, nihil suspicari,
dies unus alter plures: non referri, and ἓ 177, infra. 'In passages ex-
pressive of emotion, or picturing a passing series of events, the infin. is
often used, as expressing the simple factos action without the ordinary
grammatical qualifications ε as a man in alarm will cry ‘ Murder l ' It is
a return to primitive speech. R. 1359, r. 539. 21. 1000, ‘common-
place,' ‘hackneyed appeal': loci communes is the general expression in
rhetorical treatises: ‘general passages‚')(‘ those with a special reference.’
V. de Orat. i. ἓ 56, curn illi in dicendo inciderint loci . . . ut de dis immor-
talibus, de pietate . . . sit dicendum (with Prof. Wilkins‘ note); ib. iii.
