140 EXPLANATORY NoTEs. [xxx. 83

actions expressed in the principal and the dependent verbs is a mere rela-
tion of time ; by the subj. if it is a connection of purpose, intention, con-
sequence, and the like: and the principal tenses, viz, pres.‚ perf.‚ fut„
are those commonly employed in the former case (the imperf. also may
denote a past state). Thus it is with cum, ‘ when’ : it commonly takes
pres.‚ perf.‚ or fut. indic., imperf. and pluperf. subj. But (a) tum may
precede cum, marking that it gives a mere date or note of time : Phil. vi.
ξ 11, oderat tum cum ille tabulis novis adversabatur. (b) There is the con-
struction of ‘ cum- inversum ': cum=et tum, and takes indic. R. 1733,
r. 735. (c) But a large residuum of instances remains unexplained.
From the classieal period onwards there was a growing tendency to prefer
the subj. in past time. But in this, as in some other matters, Cicero
retains much of the practice of the early school of writers. Two German
writers, Hoffmann and Liibbert (the latter in a treatise of 25 5 pages)‚ have
recently examined the whole subject, and compiled statistics. Caesar uses
the Subj. 383 times, the Indic. 35 times ; Livy the Subj. 2864 times, the
Indic. 272 times; Tacitus the Subj. 278 times, the Indic. 94 times 3¹
whereas Plautus has the Subj. 9 times, the Indic. 229 times. As
to the Imperf. Indic. with cum, Cic. has it 241 times (including the ad
Herenn. ), Caesar 4 times, Tac. once. It is frequent in Cicero’s letters as a
mere note of time ε ad Fam. iii. 13. 2, cum haec scribebam . . . sperabam.
Also when the subject of the two verbs is the same ι especially when the
cum clause appends an explanation, as Verr. ii. Ι. 121, ridiculi vide-
bantur esse, cum Sacerdotem exsecrabantur. But the present passage
shows how capricious the usage is. Hoffmann’s distinction between the
absolute time of the indic. and the relative time of the subj. (for which
v. the account in Lewis and short, art. 2. cum, C. , which is as clear as
may be) does not help us much here. The accident of identity of subjects
to mittebant and requirebant may have led to the use of the indic. in the
latter of the two cum-clauses (v. R. 1729, r. 731). Draeger's parallels
are not exact: the compat-ison of T usc. ii. ἓ 35, cum varices secabantur
C. Mario, laborabat, with ib. ἓ 53, C. Marius cum secaretur . . . vetuit se
adligari, is misleading: the former passage gives a mere definition of
labor, sc. dolam not sothe latter. A speaker is happily innocent of the
subtleties of scientific grammar, as he chooses his words. His ear, and
the unconscious memory of his previous usage, determine his choice to a
large extent. Style is something between a growth and a fabric ; it is
neither of these exclusively. It is not even exempt from physical re-
strictions. The ‘personal sactor' may at any time enter and upset the
calculations of science. [The chapter in Roby on the ‘ Subj. (F),
Attendant Circumstanees ' will be found to be the most practical authority
on this question.] 21. On the retirement of the jury to consider their
