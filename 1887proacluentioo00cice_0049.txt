INTRODUCTION. xli

one Sex. Vibius, proscribed and put to death at Larinum.
This was because he was threatened with proceedings on
account of the last-mentioned murder, ξ 2 5.

8. He murdered two of his sons, by Papia and Novia re-

spectively, because Sassia refused to become the stepmother

to three children.

9. At some time before this he instigated one of his
creatures, a certain Avillius, to murder a rich and dissolute
young man, Asuvius of Larinum, having previously forged
his will.· He was arrested by Manlius, the triumvir, and only
escaped by bribing this worthless magistrate to abandon the
case.

10. The council of Larinum declared him guilty of falsi-
fying the municipal records, ἕ 41.

11. Lastly, he made an attempt on the life of Cluentius, for
which he was ultimately brought to justice, and convicted of
an attempt to poison.

VII. THE WIVEs OF OPPIANICUS.

Oppianicus was married at least five times. There is no
single statement in the speech either as to the number of his
wives, or as to the order of their succession. But the following
ι list ls pretty certainly correct: —

1. CLUENTIA, sister of Cluentius the elder, she takes

precedence of the rest, as belonging to an earlier generation.

2. MAGIA, daughter of Dinaea, by whom he had a son,

ἶ, Oppianicus the younger.

3. PAPIA, who was living at Teanum Apulum, evidently
divorced from her husband, with her young son, whom Op-

pianicus sent for and murdered just before his marriage with

Sassia (ἐξ 27, 28). She is to be identified with the widow of

Cn. Magius, who had lent herself to his evil purposes and

married him, ‘quae nuptiae non diuturnae fuerunt z erant enim

“ non matrimonii dignitate, sed sceleris societate coniunctae,⁷

ἓ 35,-—words which suggest divorce rather than decease.
4. Nole, whose infant son Oppianicus murdered within

5² ten days of the murder of his son by Papia. We may suppose
that if Novia had then been alive, but divorced, Cic. would
’ have enlarged upon her maternal grief.

χ 5. SASSIA, widow of A. Aurius Melinus and of A. Cluentius
J Habitus the elder.
