xx INTRODUCTION.

law of L. Aurelius Cotta, B.c. 70: that in fact it should be
proposed to make a new interpretation, amounting to an
alteration of the law, retrospective in its action. But in
weighing these objections it must be remembered that the
spirit of Roman justice at this time was not the same as the
spirit of modern law—courts, which is the product of agencies
now many centuries at work. In the interval the whole
structure of Roman law has been reared, of which then
the foundatiOns were barely visible: and generations of
jurists and philosophers have laboured to purify and enlarge
the ideal of justice.1

As to the latter of the preceding objections, we may perhaps
wonder that if Accius really laid himself open to it, Cicero
did not avail himself of it. Probably he felt that it was less
cogent than his main argument, that Cluentius was not, by
the letter of the law, in any way liable under Chapter vl. For
that argument of course Accius was prepared. We may
suppose that he had anticipated it by a direct negative. He
probably urged that a correct interpretation of the lex Cornelia,
as it stood, was sufficient to bring all offenders, according
to Chapter VL, including the knight Cluentius, under the scope
of that chapter. This is implied in§ 150, iniquum tibi videtur,
Acci, esse non isdem legibus omnes teneri3 g 156, agit sic
causam T. Accius, adulescens bonus et disertus, omnes cives
legibus teneri omnibus. The former of these passages rather

than the latter gives Accius’ real words Again ἕ 145, in?

dignum esse facinus, si senator iudicio quempiam circumvenerit,
legibus eum teneri ε si Eques Romanus hoc idern fecerit, non
teneri. In ἓ 160, ne conatus quidem esset dicere, id quod
multis verbis egit, iudicem, quod ei videatur statuere et non
devinctum legibus esse oportere: these words imply that
Accius had proposed some subjective interpretation of the
letter of the law. And he urged the jurors to condemn
Cluentius, and thereby establish a salutary precedent. His
antagonist was not slow to take up the political gauntlet thus
thrown down.

1 Even nOW, too, questions of moral obligation will arise, relating to
advocacy, which cannot be solved off-hand. Cp. some remarks in an
article on ‘ Casuistry ' by the Rev. Chancellor Cazenove(C0ntemp. Rcview,

June 1874).
