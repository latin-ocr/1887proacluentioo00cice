160 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XL. 110

l. 2. 6. aliquis, ‘ some one' )(nemo ; quilibet, quivis would be ‘ any
one,' as in the proverb ‘ non cuivis contingit adire Corinthum.’

XL. 110.—10. ad quinquaginta, prope quinquaginta.—MAN. 11. pa.-
trom, ‘ an advocate '3 advocati, ‘ a legal adviser' or ‘backer’z cp. n.
on ἓ 54, l. 25, advocabat, for the proper meaning of these words. In Plaut.
Poenulus iii. 1 Agorastocles employs certain citizens (called advocati) to
lure the pander into a trap and then act as testes against him. 28. lauda-
toris, ‘ witness to character,' n. on ἓ 56, l. 23. 12. Rostra, the
tribune in the Roman sorum, so {called from the ships' beaks, taken in
the Latin war, with which it was ornamented. V. Rich. Dict. Ant.
(Never called ‘ Rostrum ' in Latin.) Cp. de imp. Pomp. § 55, non
pudebat magistratus populi Romani in hunc ipsum locum escendere, cum
eum nobis maiores nostri exuviis nauticis et classium spoliis ornatum reli·
quissent. 13. iam diu . . . a tribunicia voce desertum: this must
not be taken to imply that the tribunes by the legislation of Sulla lost the
right agendi cum populo. The restrictions which Sulla imposed (especially
on their right to introduce a rogation) were not taken off until B.C. 70 ς
and the agitation of Quinctius of itself shows that the tribunes of preceding
years were silent, not because they could not, but because they would not,
speak. Momms. R. Staatsr. ii. 296 n. 2 (cp. also Momms. R. Η. iii.
p. 364). Cp. n. on ἓ 74. 14. On the use of a here instead of the
instrumental abl. v. crit. n. ad veteris . . . simnitudinem, ‘to
something like the former practice.’ 15. ‘ On whose shoulders he had
risen to still greater eminence.'

111.--20. illam usque ad talos demissam purpuram3 viz. the toga
praetexta (purple-edged toga) of the curule magistrate, which was not worn
by the quaestor or lower officials, nor by plebeian magistrates such as the
tribunes, none of whom enjoyed the curule chair. It is to be observed
that the sense of the passage requires us to refer these words to a time
subsequent (postea, 1. 17) to Quinctius’ tribunate. It is to be supposed that
Quinctius after his tribunate rose ‘ to a higher place‚' to the curule aedile-
ship or praetorship. (So Cic. derides Vatinius for having as tribune
bought a praetexta to be ready against the aedileship which never came to
him, z‘n Vatin. ἓ 16). Some of the older scholars falsely referred the words
to the period of Quinctius' tribunale, but an express statement of Plutarch
forbids this : περιπόρφυρον ὁ δήμαρχος οὐ φορεῖ τῶν ἄλλων ἀρχόντων
φορούντων, q. R. 81. Graevius gives the above view as that of Rubenius.
