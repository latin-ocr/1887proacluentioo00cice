LXV1.189] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 211

old adj. manus meaning ‘ good’ (according to Varro), and connected with
Ama, to measure, thus signifying ‘ unmeasured‚’ ‘unwieldy,’ ‘savage.'
Manes (‘the good people,' τῖε. spirits), mane (ί in good time’), Manius
(‘ the early-bom ') are cognate words. 12. voluerit, optaverit, cogna-
verit, effecerit: a good climax. For the first two words cp. ἓ 178 n.
Cogito (co-agito) is properly ‘to work a thing up in one’s mind,' so here ‘to
work up details into a coherent plan,' ‘to design.' 16. commune famfflae
dedecus: cp. the words of ἓ 16, tulit hoc commune dedecus familiae,
cognationis, nominis graviter filius. 17. ‘ I do not complain of her second
marriage with Opp.’: it was her third in fact ι but in the present context
he only takes count of two marriages, that with A. Aurius Melinus and that
with Opp. quarum ma, cet„ ‘by contracting which—-but not until she
had taken securities of him in his sons’ lives—she made her new horne a
house of mouming, and signed the death-warrant of her stepsons ’-—z'n ex-
presses the result, not a common use before Livy: cp. in rem esse, ‘to
be usesul.' 20. A. Aurium . . . cum . . . esse proscriptum cognosset: the
tendency of Latin writers is to place the temporal conjunctions cum and
ubi in the second place, or even later, in the clause which they govern,
except in the case of the shortest clauses.

189.—24. quod nunc denique patefactum est: her eomplicity in the
plot against the life of Cluentius is sufficiently clear from her present
animosity against him. 25. venem, gen. of definition : lit. ‘the crime,
viz, the attempt to poison ' : cp. virtus iustitiae. R. 1302, r. 523 a.
lam tum recens)(nunc vero, ‘in those early days ’ 3 recens is an adj. 3
not an adverb, a use not found in Cic. 27. non est . . . celata. maten
‘certainly his mother was not kept in the dark as to that attempt to
poison.' ,Here Cic. takes up his words, ‘illud primum queror de illo
scelere,' after the parenthetic quod . . . videtur. When he says in that par-
enthesis that the attempt was, when first discovered, ‘matter of mere
suspicion to people in general, and to my client inconceivable,’ he is not
admitting that there was any doubt as to the existence of the plot, but
only as to its having existed matre conscia. Graevius indeed supposes an
anacoluthon: de illo scelere (which should have been continued non est
celata mater) being repeated non est profecto de i. v. c. m. after the inter-

ruption of the relative sentence: comparing ἓ 12, nam Sassia . . . ea -

igitur mater Habiti, cet. But this is forced. celata: observe that
the personally used pass. verb celer does not take an acc. of the thing
(unless it be a neut. pron., such as lzoc), but prefers the prepositional
government, which indeed is often similarly preferred in the act. : Sull.
ἓ 39, credo celatum esse Cassium de Sulla uno. Cp. Bradl. Arn. ἓ 231.
29. quod 81 esset=quod si quicquam ita cogitatum esset3 V. crit. n.
31. scelerum adfluentem : there is no other ex, of this construction with
adfluens z but it is by no means alien to the genius of the language. If
Cic. can write refertam Graeciam sceleratissimorum (Plane. 598), surely
he may also write scelerum affluens. V. R. 1336, r. 5303 and also crit.
