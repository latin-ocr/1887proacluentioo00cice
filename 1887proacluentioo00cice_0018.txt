x INTRODUCTION.

nically at least, Cluentius was not liable under it.1 But
there are good reasons for believing that Accius accused
Cluentius not merely collaterally, but expressly under this
clause of the statute in question, as well as under the
poisoning clause. We shall discuss this point more fully
hereafter.

ἓ 3. This speech was delivered when Cicero was forty-one
years of age. He was in the prime of life and intellectual vigour,
and had risen by his own unaided talents and energy to a
high position in public life. Not only was he acknowledged
leader of the bar, he was also a force in politics, a champion
of the Equestrian order (the powerful middle class of that
day). As such, four years since, he had crushed the sena-
torial arch-criminal Verres by his irresistible eloquence, and
in this very year had contributed not a little by his speech
pro lege Manilia 2 to the success of the rogation which super-
seded Lucullus, the senatorial general, by Cn. Pompeius, at
this time the leader of the Equites.

As yet, moreover, he had known no rebuffs and no humilia-
tion: his triumph over Verres, against whom he levels a

passing word of contempt in this speech, if it was not executed >

on as grand a scale as his defeat of Catiline, had not left
behind it any sting of misgiving as to the possible consequences
to himself of his action. It had left him the regnum iudzkt‘orum.
He had every reason to be satisfied with the past and to be μ
sanguine as to the future. For his ambition naturally did
not end with the praetorship: the- wave of fortune was not
likely to ebb until it had carried him to the consulship.
He also occupied the chief place among the literary men of
the capital. In proof of this, it is enough to say that Cicero
had successfully combated the ‘Asiatic style ' of Q. Hortensius
and the ‘Attic style' of C. Licinius Calvus (the former the
style of his own youthful productions, especially the pro
Quinctio and pro Rosc. Am), and formed an eclectic style
which was truly his own, and acknowledged to be the best.
54. After these considerations we shall not be surprised
to find that the style of this speech is characterised‚ as far
as the nature of the subject will admit, by all the highest
qualities of the oratory of the speaker. We shall presently

have to estimate the persuasive adroitness which could ’κ

construet out of a confusing mass of facts and figments, plots ἶ
