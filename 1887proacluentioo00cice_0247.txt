arguments, though he works round in ἓ 142 to the latter, which, however,
even then he rather toys with than adopts. How can we account for his
choice? Perhaps it is best explained by his weakness of character, espe-
cially as this appeared in political timidity. In politics (ἓ 141) requiritur
constantia. To take the bolder ground would be to confess that the
party-cry of 13.C. 74-70 rested on facts so called, the most signal of which
was untrue. So though the whole contentiori of the speech is a denial of
the truth of that fact, he cannot frame his lips to deny it here in so many
words. He dare not confess to his inconsistency. He prefers the glaring
sophism of ἓ 139, that ‘in his speeches it is not he that speak3‚ but his
client's case personified’ ἔ Thus the politician gets the better of the advo-
cate, and the case suffers. Certainly the ‘ causa Cluenti,’ if allowed to speak
for itself, would not have chosen this line of desence. A wise advocate
would scarcely disclaim all personal conviction as to the argument which he
adopts. 14. auct. nostras consignatas, ‘the certified declaration of
my views.’ V. Glossary‚ auctoritas. 15. causarum, not a mere gen. of
connection or possession, ‘appropriate to the case and moment': but
actually subjective, ‘ the utterance of the case with its immediate require-
ments.' The orator is the mere mouthpiece of the case. Thus only can
the connection with the next sentence (nam, sl . . .) be explained.

guished orators of the generation preceding Cicero’s: ‘the first a sels-
taught man, who owed everything to his excellent memory, natural viva-
city‚ and quick imagination, and whose chief merit lay in his brilliant
delivery: [omnium eloquentissimus quos ego viderim3 T usc. v. §55 ι]
Crassus, a man of acute intellect and juridical training, hence as an orator
less taking than Antonius, but persuasive through his lucid explanations,
and winning through merry wit and elegant language ' (Teuffel, R. Lit.

by the followers of Marius and Cinna, B.C. 87. 20. nullam . . .
