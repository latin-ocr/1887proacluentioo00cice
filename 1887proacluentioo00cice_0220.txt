156 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xxxvn. 104

that particular offence.’ [committere is ‘to bring to issue’ or ‘ effect‚’
and hence equally applicable to crime or its punishment. So we say,
‘incur a punishment,’ and ‘incur a fault. ’-H. J. R.] , The same
interchang'e of application appears in Greek in such phrases as ὀφλεῖν
δειλίαν, ‘to owe a judicial fine for,’ z'.e. ‘ be found guilty of cowardice.’
For this absolute use of accepisse=acc. pecuniam, cp. ξ 113, quis accepit?

104. —32. With what Cic. says here of the second trial of Fidiculanius
Falcula for having taken a bribe from Cluent. we must contrast what he s
said in the pro Caec. ἓ 29. Η8 is disparaging the value of Falcula’s evi·
dence. When he gave it, he was asked how many miles (quot millia)
Caecina's farm lay from Rome: and on his replying, minus 1000, ‘less
than 50 miles,' with a roar of laughter the audience cried ‘ ipsa esse‚' ‘ the
exact figure !' ‘ For they remembered,' Cic. sayS‚ ‘ how much he had
received in the iudicium Albianum.' 33. Qua. lege . . . a. senatore
ratio repeti so1et: this seems to imply that only senators were liable
under the lex [Cornelia] de repetundis, the existing statute on the matter.
So also the words at the beginning of ξ 148, where Cic. says that if
T. Accius (an eques, v. n. on ἓ 62) were impeached under this law
he would protest ‘ se lege pecuniarum repetundarum non teneri.' (It is
in fact stated in Rab. Post. ξ 12 that the lex Julia de pecun. repet. did not
apply to the Equites.) But this certainly does not hold in regard to the ⁴
WHOLE lex de repetundis: Verr. ii. 2. 77 notices the fact that a non-
senatorial defendant could only challenge three iudices. It is therefore
not unlikely that, as Mr. Peterson conjectures (n. on ξ 98), the application
of those sections of the law de repetundis which related to judicial corruption
(which seem to appear first in the 18)( Cornelia de repet. of Sulla, B.C. 81)
was confined to senatorS, which would be analogous to the similar limita·
tion in the case of the sixth chapter of the lex Cornelia de sicariis (v. infr.
ch. liv.). When the leges Corneliae were passed all iudices were
senators: but while the 18)( Aurelia of B.C. 70 extended the privilege of
judging to other orders, the responsibility for judicial action was (by a
survival, and now an anomaly) still limited to senators. Cp. n. on ἓ 148.1

¹ Zumpt’s view somewhat differs from this. He holds that the lex Julia connects
immediately with the lex Calpurnia of Rc. 149: that intermediate laws dealt with
repetundae not by itself but only in connection with other official offences Ξ that down
to the time of the lex Aurelia of 13.c. 70 there was a recognised distinction, acknowledged
by Sulla, between official offences and ordinary offences, and a distinct procedure for
each. Thus the persons liable under the lex Cornelia de repetundis must have been (a)
all senatorial Officers, (b) all senators, (c) certain officials whose office was the first step
to promotion. But the lex Julia of Caesar included not only senators and senatorial
officers, but also other persons who exercised a share of the state-control. As to Rab.
Post. ἓ 12, 118 compares ib. §19‚ Postumo . . . qui nec tribunus nec praefectus nec ex
Italia comes nec familiaris Gabinii : these words themselves cannot have stood in the
lex Julia: Pompeius had in vain proposed to introduce them (§ 13). But some vague
expression (such as cohors), under which even the knight Postumus might have been

brought, must have stood there. The frr. of the lex Acilia repetundarum support this
view—that officials, senatorial or equestrian, were liable (Zumpt, Criminalr. ii. 2. 29⁶)-
