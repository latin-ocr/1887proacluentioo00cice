144 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [xxxn. 89

ἕ 185, illam nefariam mulierem. We may say of all these adjectives
(except the first, and perhaps Planc. ἓ 73), that they are superlative in
idea, or (in two instances) participial. Where the adj. isan integral part
of the noun idea, this rule does not apply. Nor does it concern expres-
sions such as Verr. i. ξ 36, hoc scelere nefario, ἓ 30, hanc mortem
repentinam, where the adj. stands outside. Here it is natural to take up
in ista multa iud. the actual words of the objector, l. 13, iud. permulta.
21. ruinae, ‘ an avalanche 'v or a landslip ε cp. the phrase ‘ trahere ruinam.’

quaestionis, § 55, quaesitor, v, n. and ref. [Momms., R. Staatsr. ii.
572, pronounces this one of the most difficult to understand of Roman
institutions.] This judgeship seems to have had its fixed place in the scale
of official promotions: from ἓ 79 (homo aedilicius, iam praetor opin-
ione hominum constitutus) we should infer that it came between the
aedileship and praetorship. Yet it was not a magistracy conferred by
vote of the comitia: it is indeed distinguished from such magistracies.
The iud. quaestionis must have been nominated by the praetor, who
properly presided over his quaestio : or the office followed upon the aedile-

ship in course, as a proconsulship did upon a consulship. It was of a ⁷

year's duration. It is especially associated with the quaestio de sicariis et
veneficis, one of the busiest eourts during this period of social anarchy.
Consult Ry. Introd. to this speech, ἓ 9; Momms. R. Staatsr. ii.2 574,
575. ‘So far was the tribune from making any allowance for the
necessities of the action that he would not respect those of the law
itself.’ Causae, the case of his adversary: the praetor (according to
Sylvius) allowed the defendant ten days' grace for getting it up. Legi
(not ‘law' in the abstract, which would be legibus, but) the particular
law which defined the rights of a iudex quaestionis. We need not (with
P.) suppose a zeugma. By a forcible figure Cic. says ‘not only did he
show Junius no mercy‚ give him no tether: lae showed the law
z'tself no mercy.’ It was not merely rigid interpretation of the
law ς it was its positive violation. Lemaire denies that there was any lex
in the above sense : it was, he thinks, mere ‘ mos ' or habitual usage which
ensured immunity from citation to the iud. quaestionis. He denies that the
office was a magistracy in any sense of the word, and considers legi mere
rhetoric. For non modo (non) cp. n. on ξ 9. 32. Quo tempore . . .
