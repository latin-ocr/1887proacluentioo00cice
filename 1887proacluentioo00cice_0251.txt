Cp. Phil. ii. 118, sed de te tu videris (v. Mayor), ‘it is for you to consider

your own interests.' This use is ‘in post-Comic writers almost confined

to videro.'—R. 1485, 1593, and pref. cvi, cvii ; r. 609. 5. 667 (c). 1 1. ‘ In

ν. Gloss. 14. mens, animus, consilium, sententia: ‘mind‚ soul,

judgment, convictions.' We must not look for exact psychology in an

orator: the words are used in their popular sense, mens denoting the

reasoning faculty, animus the acting or motor force of will, passion, etc.

Consilium is the expression of mens z sententia of animus. So Verg. uses γ

one save the young son of the latter was allowed to pass between him
and the lictor. Cp. Liv, xxviii. 27, lictor apparuit, summoto incesserunt,
