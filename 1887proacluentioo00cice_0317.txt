XLv. 126] CRITICAL NOTES. f 253

22. populo, ST; populo Romano, R; the Romano is due to the
initiat r of rescindi. 24. sint, T.

XLIV. 123.—27. After censor-ee, S (sec. manu) adds de 1110 iudicio
corrupto. 29. 81 qiua, S, Bait„ Kays. ; 81 ideo quia, R, except B,which
omits 81 quia subscr. Page 47, l. 2. dictatorium, sc. stilum, S, KayS.

Ἴ ’ dictatorium gladium, R. ;Bait., Klotz, Miill. bracket gladium. True, we

have in Muren. ἓ 30, cedat forum castris, otium militiae, stilus gladio:
but there Cic. is contrasting civil pursuits with military : here the subscriptio
of the censor with the proscriptio of the dictator, both officers of state
using the stilus in different ways, In B.C. 82, Sulla at the request of Q.
Metellus Pius published in the Forum a list of those whom a few strokes
of his ‘ dictatorius stilus ' consigned to execution.

124.—3. quia verum' sit. Halm conj. The indic. of the objective fact
is better than the subj., which, like subscripserint in l. 28 supr„ would
express something subjective, the idea in the minds of Cic. and the jury.
V. explan. n. on l. 28. 7. quem ad modum dederit, om. ST.
aliquod inserted after denique by all MSS. except T which omits, and
S which has aliquid after Cluentio. It seems that aliquid was a gloss
on unum which has been included in the text in one place by S, in
in another by the other MSS. which also read aliquod, the adjectival form.
11. auctoritatem censorum amplexato, Priscian, viii. 5, 26: censoriam,

· STF : censorum, M: amplexator, STM, which Kays. says all known

codd. read ; though Bait. implies that amplexato is read by F, Class. that
it is read by all codd. except STM, and two others. Lamb. preferred -to :
which was the reading of one Pal. MS. The homoeoteleuton with
defendite is in its favour. As to the form (act. for deponent) it is a
survival from an older stage of the language in which many such forms
were unfixed. Draeger (Hz'st. Synt. i. p. 150) enumerates 126 instances
from Varro, etc. (Oscito instanced there from Cic.‚ is uncertain.)
12. coniunctum esse cum re, T ; coniunctum cum re esse, S 3 cum re
coniunctum, esse, R.

125.—-14. manu sua, ST: 8111, R. 16. curaverit, ST: curarit,
FM. Same variation in l. 17, necaverit, 1. 18, curaverit3 cp. §9o, n.
20. abortione, S (and cod. S. Vict.): potione, TFM. The latter would
refer to the death of Dinaea, which is mentioned in the words following3
but the crime in connection with Magius’ wife (ἓ 34) would then be
omitted, which is unlikely. 21. uxores, ST, cod. S. Vict. ε uxorem,
R; the rhetorical plural is supported by ἓ 52, Oppianici hominis in
uxoribus necandis exercitati: and perhaps ἓ 171 a socrus, a fratris, ab
uxorum, a liberum Poenis actum esse. Strictly speaking, Cluentia was the
only wife whom he murdered (according to Cicero), ἓ 30. 23. dare
vellet, ST; quaereret, R, a reminiscence of ἓ 55, esse quaesitum.
28. ista, ipsa, T.

XLV. 126.——31. dicant, F and some inferior MSS. So Kl. It would give
a fair sense, ‘though they should state their case as strongly as possible.'
