other obligations, together with my obligation to my client now imperilled.'
28. vestrl, ST; but this form is never partitive. Sen. N. Q. Ι. praef.
has nostri melior pars animus est, ‘of us,' not as a thing divided, but
as an undivided whole, ‘ of our being.’ But always uterque nostrum, etc.
29. officit, all Mss. ; Man. emended, 1540. 30. consuetudo, ST, cod.
Lamb.—scarcely an advance upon usus ; necessitudo est, R. I follow
Class. and Kays. A Palatine MS. of Gruter had consuetudo vel
necessitudo: evidently consuetudo is a scribe's gloss„ which crept in
and ousted necessitudo.

118.—-32. rationem, STFM. Pago 45, 1. 5. ex hac, ST; in hac,
R 3 explained to mean, in hac libertate, ‘in the exercise of this‚' but it is not
clear with what verb it should be connected. Lamb. corr. in hoc, which
Gruter supports from some MSS„ and Or. adopts. Then quam ipse . . .
dicendi must be taken, ‘ with the loyalty . . . which he has always shown.'
6. possim, ST; possum, R. The subj. is needed, for quantum is
restrictive, R. 1694, r. 710. 8. eius, ST. Cp. ἐξ 22, 46, 198, n.n.

119.—15. tempus exemplis, Ponam, all MSS. but ST, and this Class.
retains, thinking that the final s being mistaken for c was the origin of
causa. 22. ad: in, ST. Cp. ξ 111.

120. —26. quos autem ipsi 1.. Gellius et Gn. Lentulus, conj. Pluygers,
who brackets duo censores.

XLIII. 31. neminem, om. T. Pago 46, l. 4. causam, om. ST;
vim, conj. Halm.

121.—-5. solum illud, ST; solum iudices, illud, R. 7. sublatas,
ST, cod. Lamb. ; deletas, F3 delatas, M, which gives a trace of the
true reading. The subscriptio would not be ‘ erased‚’ but ‘ annulled' by
the action of electors or jurors. 10. accepisse, ST 3 cepisse, R. Cp.
accepit, ἓ 113, l. 15. Both ‘words are thus used. 13. lectos, ST;
selectos, R. The meaning is the same, whichever reading we adopt;
v. explan. n. Hor. Serm. i. 4. 123,

unum ex iudicibus selectis obiciebat.

An inser. Momms. C. I. l. p. 65, xviii. supports lectos. Cp. also§ 120,
1. 3. 14. impedimentum e. o. dixerunt, F; and others.

122.—16. appellare, ST; appellari, R. 19. praescindat, ST.
20. aerario referre, ST; movere, ST. Ι have ventured to adopt the
Active Infinitives: all other MSS. and edd. read referri, moveri. No ’
doubt we cannot rely implicitly on the best of MSS. for the choice between
1 and e. But Cic. is not unlikely, having begun with movere velit,
l. 19 (which Or. and Grut. corrected to moveri velit, despite all MSS),
to keep the Act. Ins. throughout : which may be used after iubeo without
an accus. subject expressed, ag. Catil. iii. ἕ 20 (haruspices) iusserunt
simulacrum Iovis facere, where consulentes must be supplied, leg. agr. ii.
§28‚ iubet ferre legem. Hor. C. ii. 3. 14, flores amoenae ferre iube rosae.

So here the accus, subject scribas, or some such word, is to be supplied.
