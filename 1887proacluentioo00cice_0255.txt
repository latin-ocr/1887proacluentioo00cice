willing to allow the equites an immunity in law which they enjoy thern·
selves in fact. It is the unworthy members of the senate who demand the
change: those who insist that is any order in the state shall have carte
blanche to do what it likes, that order shall be their own, expect thus to
possess themselves of a threat with which to intimidate the equestrian
iudices who might exposesshem. [We may remark that Cic. blinks the
fact that iudicia are not composed of equites alone, or senators alone ε to
make the equestrian jurors responsible is not to make the senatorial jurors
irresponsible. As easily, under existing arrangements, might a guilty eques
intimidate senatorial jurors. In fact the true conclusion is—the change is
demanded by all who know the dangers of irresponsible power, no
matter to whom committed, but Cic., having confused the issue, hastens
on to other ground before this objection can take shape in the minds
s of his hearers] (b) Negative argument, on the principle of ‘quieta
non movere.' The balance of power between the two orders still,
as in the days of M. Drusus, maintains the equilibrium of the state.
5. integritate, ‘honesty': cp. ἓ 133, de huius pudore integritate virtute.
7. cupiditate, not, as in §66, ‘ party-spirit‚’ but simply ‘greed ' ; sine
cupid.=integritate above. V. n. on cupidiore, ἓ 66. equites ordini
senatorio dignitate proximos, concordia coniunctissimos: these words
are interesting as an anticipation of Cicero’s political creed enunciated
a sew years after this time. In the coalition of senators and equites (‘ causa
optima,' ad Att. ii. 16. 4) he hoped to find a counterpoise to the growing
forces of democracy soon to issue (though Cic. was too short-sighted
to, perceive it) in Caesarism. Cp. his resume of his speech made
aster Pompeius’s return from the East: haec erat ὑπόθεσις; de gravitate
ordinis [sc. senatorii]‚ de equestri concordia, cet. 8. sese volunt
posse omnia: the infin. after verbs of wishing has a pronominal subject (volo
me esse), when it is desired to throw out the whole idea, thus conveyed‚
as something distinct and contemplated already as if it were realised:

obs. 4. V. crit. n. 11. si constitutum sit . . . iudicarint: v. critsn.
14. ‘ To take out the sting of your severity.’ The notion that bees leave
their sting in the wound which they make is an ancient one: cp. Flacc.
ἓ 41, mortuus est aculeo iam emisso ac dicto testimonio; and Verg.
G. iv. 238, et spicula caeca relinquunt Ι adfixae venis, animasque in
volnere ponunt (Mr. Reid on Sull. ἓ 47).

LVI. 153.—20. In B.C. 91, the tribune, M. Livius Drusus, attempted
to purisy the law-courts by two important measures: the iudices, instead
of being taken from the equites alone, were to be chosen from the senate,
which was to be enlarged by the admission of 300 equites 3 and, secondly,
there was to be a special quaestio sor the trial of jurors who had been or
should be guilty of accepting bribes (Momms. R. H. iii. 222). The
latter law, being thus retrospective, was fiercely attacked by the equites,
and waS, with Drusus’s other proposals, speedily rejected on the ground
