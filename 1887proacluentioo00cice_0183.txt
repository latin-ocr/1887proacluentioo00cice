epithet ; ‘ usu venire (lit. come in practice), happen, turn out‚’ R. 1238,
n. 3, r. 503. 2, where other instances will be found. 15. hoc 1000, ‘in
this part of his arguments testibus: the simple ablative is used be-
cause the persons denoted are regarded not as agents but as instruments.
In such a case pgr with the accusative is commonet. Cp. ad Q.
Fr. iii. 3, (Gabinius) maxime testibus caeditur, and note on l. 20.
R. 1213, 1220, r. 499. ‘The case broke down under the evidence of
most respectable witnesses.’ 19. summa religione et summa
auetofitate praeditus, ‘ a scrupulously truthful man whose word 'carried
the greatest weight.' 20. Habito, dative3 so facere alicui, a dativus
commodi or incommodi, as the case may be. Hor. Serm. i. 1. 63,
quid facias illi? Itis also used with the personal abl. instrumenti,
(Sest. 5 29, quid hoc homine facias ?) in the sense of ‘ putting a person to
a certain use.’ So ἓ 186, quid istis hominibus sactum est, Stratone et
Nicostrato? Cp. Professor Palmer's note on Hor. l.c.

54-23. re quidem vera: ‘ but in reality.' This adversative use of
quidem is often forgotten. It is more commonly concessive (cp. ἓ 5ο),
and occurs in the former member of an antithesis. We may compare
the adversative use of μήν (a strengthened μέν) in Greek. Cp. Sest. § 15,
intentus est arcus in me unum, sicut volgo loquebantur, re quidem in

rempublicam ε and ἓ 132 n. 24. tota accusatione, v, crit. n.
‘Throughout the prosecution.' For the simple ablative of place with
totus or medius as attribute, v, R. 1170, r. 486. 25. ‘ And he made no

secret of it.' Cp. Liv. xxii. 14. 15, haud dubie ferebant Minucium Fabio
ducem praelaturos. In this phrase ferre means to ‘bring out‚' ‘show':
sometimes ‘to do so in words,' ‘ declare ’ ; v, Glossary. 2 5. frequens,
‘ constantly.’ Pis. ἓ 80, cum P. Lentulo consuli frequens adsideret. [Or‚
with a glance at the phrase frequens miles, ‘ he was there in his place punctu-
ally,' ‘ on all occasions ' ?—H. N.] advocabat, ‘ beat up his supporters. ’
An advocatus was not necessarily a legal advz'ser: it denoted generally ‘ any
friend who lent his aid, countenance, or advice,’ attending in court during
the trial. Cp. Pseudo-Asconius on Cic. Dz‘v. in Caec. ξ 20, qui defendit
alterum in iudicio aut patronus dicitur, si orator est, aut advocatus si aut
ius suggerit aut praesentiam suam commodat amico. So in Hor. Serm. i. 9.
38 (the Bore), ‘ Si me amas,' inquit, ‘ paulum hic ades,’ ‘inteream si aut
valeo stare aut novi civilia iura,' i.e. ‘ I cannot simply appear (stare=
adesse), much less give professional advice.’ Mr. Peterson quotes Cic.
Phil. i. 16, vellem adesset Antonius, modo sine advocatis; Dem. a'e Cor.
275. 20, οἱ ἐκ παρακλήσεως συγκαθήμενοι. Advocatio denotes ‘not only
the act qf'callz‘ng upon friends for assistance in judicial matters, but also
the time allowed to a defendant to prepare for his trial: advocationes

postulare (ad Fam. vii. 1 1), “ to demand postponements. '' ’--Ry. There is ,

a third sense: ‘ the body of supporters thus called in '; advocatio toga-
torum, Caec. §43. [Other reff. in Holden, de Off i. §31.] It is important
to remember that advocatus ‘was never employed to denote a pleader
