, twelve) for the defence. Thus Murena was defended by Cicero,
Hortensius, and Crassus. Here vetere=antiquo, as in ἓξ 76, 107, 129,
vetus disciplina, and Cael. ἓ 73, voluit vetere instituto . . . industriam
suam a populo Romano ex aliqua inlustri accusatione cognosci. In his
earliest speeches Cic. uses antiquus always in a good sense, vetus generally
in a bad: ag. Rosc. Am. §27, vestigia antiqui officii, ib. ξ 61, veterem

tuam illam calliditatem. (Cp. Bradl. Arn. p. 355 n.) No argument,
however, can be drawn from any such distinction here. For peroravi v.

⁴ Gloss. (2) The words have been differently taken: ‘ I have pleaded

this case from beginning to end single-handed‚ as I have been want to do '
(P. ), zze. ‘according to my old practice ἐ surely a doubtful rendering of vetere
instituto, although it has the support of Manutius [and Mr. Roby]. Peroravi
in this case probably means ‘ have summed up the whole case‚' as opposed
to ‘ singillatim crimina purgare ’ : cp. its use in Tac. Ann. ii. 30, where
it is said that, a eontention having arisen between four persons for the
‘ius perorandi in reum,' one of them gains his point by undertaking
‘singillatim se crimina obiecturum,' ‘to bring forward each charge
singly.' And the words would refer to what was now a prescriptive right
of Cicero's‚ his always speaking last of the advocates engaged on the
defence. Cp. Mr. Reid's Introd. pro Balb. p. 14. But this case, in
which Cic. alone is retained, is dzfferent from a case such as that of
Sestius, in which (though he perorat) he is retained along with others.
For this and other reasons I prefer (1). The passage is quoted by Pliny
to prove his hypothesis that Cic. epitomised his speeches before publishing.
‘ Idem pro Cluentio ait, se totam caussam veteri instituto solum perorasse
et pro Cornelio quadriduo egisse: ne dubitare possimus, quae per plures
dies, ut necesse erat, latius dixerit, postea recisa ac purgata in unum
librum . . . coarctasse,’ Ep. i. 20. Here possibly ut necesse erat is
Pliny’s interpretation of vet. instit. 12. quam caecam, cet. ‘ You see
her swept along by the blind forces of cruelty and crime: her lust no
sense of infamy has ever curbed ε her distempered spirit has mos⁵t grossly
perverted every claim which humanity acknowledges : she is too demented
to bear the name of human being, too violent to bear that of woman, too
heartless to bear that of mother.' scelere ferri : cp. ἓ 12, ferri libidine,
with n. Sest. ἓ 111, latus odio. 14. hominum, used without reference
to sex, as sometimes German mensch, Greek ἅνθρωπος : Ry. quotes Eur.
Hzpp. 472, ἀλλ’ εἰ τὰ πλείω χρηστὰ τῶν κακῶν ἔχεις, Ιᾶνθρωπος οὖσα
κάρτα ’γ’ εὔ πράξειας dv: and ad Fam. iv. 5 (Ser. Sulpicius’ letter of
condolence to Cic. on the death of his daughter Tullia), quae si hoc
tempore non diem suurn obisset, paucis post annis tamen ei moriendum
fuit, quoniam homo nata fuerat. 18. uxor generi, noverca fini, imae
pelex: in Orator. ἓ 107, Cic. dwells with satisfaction on this splendid
specimen of his matured powers of invective—ab hac indole iam illa
matura: ‘uxor generi . . . peleX.' 20. ad, ‘in the way of,' lit.:
cp. ἓ 183, ad fraudem callidi.
