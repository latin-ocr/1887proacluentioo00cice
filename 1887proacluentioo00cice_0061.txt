ANALYSIS. Ι liii

Rupilius, Oppianicus' doctor, his slave Strato, and
put him with Ascla, a slave of her own, and Nico-
stratus, whom she compelled young Oppianicus to
give up, to the torture. But respectable witnesses
being there they confessed nothing, (ἓ 177) and on a
second occasion her intent became plain, and the
inquiry was closed. (ἓ 178) Sassia went in dudgeon to
Larinum, and rewarded Strato, the supposed murderer
of her husband, by setting him up as a doctor.

(ἓ 179) After three years, to secure young Oppianicus, she
betrothed to him, against his will, her daughter by
her own son-in-law: (ἓὲ 180 and 181) and then, Strato

ι being tried for a theft, she reopened the old charge,
and tortured him and Nicostratus without (ξ 182) any
independent witness (ἓ 183) Accius did not say so,
but can it be that during the inquiry about his theft
Strato told about the poison? (ἓὲ 184 and 185) No3
the minutes do not bear it out. They say nothing of
the theft. They are forged by Sassia. (ἓ 186) There
was but one witness, and he is not called before you.
(ἓ 187) Why was the inquiry held, then? why are not
the slaves called now? Why, Strato has been crucffied,
with his tongue cut out ἒ

(ἓ 188) What a monster must Sassia be! She was partner
in all Oppianicus’ crimes. (ξ 190) To secure a pro—
secutor for her son, she bound young Oppianicus to
her by every tie. (ξ 191) She trumped up the whole
charge, (ἓ 192) and is now here to help the prosecu-
tion and exult over her son. All the way to Rome
men flocked to see her pass, and to groan at her:
(ἓ 193) they thought she polluted the road she trod ;
(ἓ 194) as she passed, no one would give her shelter.
Her aim is to ruin her son, and she resorts even to
magle.

PERORATION.

(ξ 195) Save Cluentius from his mother. All Larinum is
here to aid him. (ἓ 196) They think the town itself is
on its trial. [Laudationes read.] (ξ 197) See their
decurions here, with the Frentani, Marrucini, men of
Teanum Apulum and Luceria and others. L. Volu
sienus‚ Helvidius Rufus, Cn. T udicius, all are anxious
for him ; (ἐξ 199> 200) protect him then against this
infamous woman 3 (ἓ 201) be not swayed by prejudice :
(ἓ 202) he has felt its weight long enough already.
