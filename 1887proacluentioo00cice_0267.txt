revertuntur. At any rate there is nothing there about Furies and an
Inferno. As the philosopher had not made up his mind, the orator
might say what he liked. We may condemn him for having, in such a

' matter, spoken simply sor effect, but the same thing is perhaps not

unknown in modern times. In Rosc. Am. ἓ 67, Pis. §46, he treats the

⁷ story of the Furies which haunted Orestes as a gross presentation of the

terrors of conscience, which are the true punishment of sin. 12. rell-
quisse: cp. the attraction in ἓ 138, ut mare . . . agitari, sic populum
Romanum . . . concitari, note: infin. for subj. in both cases. Cp. also
Verr. ii. 3. 216, noli igitur dicere istum idem fecisse quod Sacerdotem,
sc. fecisse for sacerdos fecerit. R. 1784 b, r. 765 b. 13. uxorum: cp.
ἓ 125, qui uxores . . . interfecerit, crit. n. liberum Poenis: cp.
Aesch. Sept. 70, Ἀρά τ’, Ἐρινὺς πατρὸς ὴ μεγασθενής. The avenging fury
is sometimes identified with the spirit of the murdered man or woman,
as when Dido says to Aeneas, Omnibus umbra locis adero: dabis,
improbe, poenas (A. iv. 386). So probably here. But more generally
the Fury is a distinct being, the incarnation of the victim's prayers or
vengeance. 15. qu1d=quid aliud z v. crit. n.

LXII. 172.-—18. atque adeo . . .‚ ‘and in fact, as the intimate
friend of Opp., he had, if anything‚ a quarrel with him.’ Adeo is a very
strong etiam here, ‘and‚ what is more '3 cp. Rosc. Am. ἓ 113, is inter
honestos homines atque adeo inter vivos numerabitur ? 21. potissimum
qualifies ei, ‘to him of all men.’ ‘Was it likely (imperf. tense), that he
would choose the man whom he knew to be more or less unfriendly to
himself, and most intimate with Opp., as his confidential agent for his
own guilty schemes, and the deadly peril of his foe ? '-a common use of
potissimum with pronouns: cp. Phil. ii. ξ 28, cur mihi potissimum
[gratulatus est Brutus]? 24. Habiti exemplo ε he refers to the trial of
Scamander, and consequent praeiudicium against Opp. ; cp. ξ 49.

173—27. faciliusne . . . posset? badlypunctuated in many edd.‚ because
the purport of the sentence is missed. There are two questions, in truth,
the first in three partsz ‘ Could the poison have worked so well if
administered in a solid instead of a liquid? Could it have escaped
detection before being administered and taken?' The former question is
threefold in expression, and of anaphoric form: faciliusne potuit, latius
potuit, celerius potuit . . . permanare? Facilius, poison in liquid is
easier to take without feeling it; latius, it diffuses itself more widely
through the veins of the victim (not as Ry.‚ ‘ through the vehicle in which
it was administered '); celerius, it operates more speedily. For latius,
cp. crit. n. The same idea, that the poison fills the veins, appears in
Hor. C. i. 37. 28, of Cleopatra—

fortis et asperas
tractare serpentes ut atro
corpore combiberet venenum.
