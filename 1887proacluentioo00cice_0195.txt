Ρ., ‘Can't I hit on some way of making Oppianicus' conviction in-

an ellipse of fiet 01 fit, as in Hor. C. iii. 9. 17, quid si prisca redit
Venus? often, as here, to introduce a forcible question. enim: no
‘ aposiopesis ' or even ellipse need be supposed. Enim gives the reason,
not indeed for the question, but for the putting of the question. So in

intrans.; generally trans., ‘to hurl headlong.' It is used absolutely at
times, like a neuter verb, ‘to sall to ruin 'z Sull. ἓ 1, praecipitante re
publica is opposed to conservata re p. A similar usage, but far less ex·
tended, appears in the case of other verbs, ag. in Liv. moveo, verto, in
Verg. rapio and proripio (quo proripis, A. v, 741), paro (cui fata parent, A.
ii. 121), accingo (accingunt omnes operi, A. ii. 235). For the metaphor,
cp. ἓ 171, 3 liberum Poenis aeturnesse praecipitem in sceleratorum
sedem; Juv. i. 149, omne in praecipiti vitium stetit, ‘ vice is at
its culminating point, its zenith.’ 1). impellamus, so Plaut. Aul. 590
(Ussing), quo incumbat eo impellere. ‘ Let us give him a push down
the incline.' perditum moster-namna ‘let us dash him down
to destruction,' Peterson. This gives a good sense, but is doubtful in
point of syntaX. Such prolepsis of the adj. or part. is only poetic or
used with factitive verbs: the use of praecipitem with dare, mittere, and
other verbs is almost unique. Madv. ἕ 481, 2.1 We get a perfectly good
sense without resorting to this: ‘Let us prostrate him when over-
thrown,' z'.e. ‘ let us give him the finishing blow.' The parallelism of the
two clauses is in favour of this. The incisive vigour of the conclusion is
helped by the alliteration. .
