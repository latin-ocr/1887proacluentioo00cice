epithet 7llz‘ser7‘z'mis‚ cp. Phil. ii. ἓ 104, o tecta ipsa misera quam dispari
domino.) 10. ego dem, T b (corr.); eo ego dem (with eo erased),
S 3 deme, R. Julius Rufin. de Fz‘g. Sent. §20, quotes thus—dem iudicibus?
mihi igitur nihil quaeretur? 12. Oppianicum, ST ; Oppianico, R.
Contrast ἓ 43, 1. 14 n. Gar. would read -um ‘etiam contra libros.'
13. quid, ST; qui, R and older edd. non fieri, ST; fieri non, R.
Madv. has restored the true punctuation : Lamb., Or., Class., Ry. have qui
(Class., Ry. quid) tandem ’.ν nihil enlm est, quod 1. n. possit. Si
quis . . . 14. reddundum : for the true spelling here we are indebted
to ST, as in ξ 69, l. 33, to T.

71.-—16. consilii, ST, Lamb. ‚ Class. , Bait„ Kays. ; consilium, R. followed
by Ramsay, who, ‘ as it is amatter of indifference which reading we seleet‚’
prefers that ‘supported by the greatest number of witnesses.' But what
if the witnesses are not independent of each other? We get what Bacon
calls ‘sequacitatem potius et coitionem, quam consensum! Just below
(end of ᾗ 73) we have hoc testimonii. Even in good MSS. (according to
Madv. de Fz'n. ii. ἓ 84), the gen. in -z' from the stem —z'o- is sometimes mis-
taken for an accus, with the -um wanting, and is falsely corrected
accordingly. 25. quo: quod, ST; cp. ἓ 66 11. 28. Guttam . . .
Bulbo, Arus. Messius, p. 263, ed. Lindem.

72.—29. avarus, ST. iis . . . degustarant, ST, and edd. since
Or. ; is . . . degustarat (which means nothing here), R, Lamb., Or., and
most older edd. Is is a common contraction in MSS. for eis: -ant is
written -ᾱί ; the stroke over the a being lost, the variant results. 30.
speculae, ST ; speguiae, R. 32. hilaro, ST ; hilari, R; cp. ξ 25, l. 19,
inermum (V. 1. inermem), cp. n. ibi-d. ; Ry. says hilaro is probably right,
and reads lzz‘lari. placidissime, ST, Bait„ Class., Miill. ; blandissime,
R and other edd. The former would merely repeat hilaro voltu—‘ revera
iratus placidum vultum simulabat Bulbus,' Class. Blandissime expresses
the coaxing tone of voice in which B. spoke. Page 28, 1. 1. aliorum,
ST. 2. magis quam, ST; magis suae quam, R. No difference is
made in the sense by the insertion of suae: it could not well imply
sarcastically (as Ry. suggests) that Staienus was really a Ligurian,
much less is it bound to imply this seriously, as older editors thought.
It is in fact superfluous. In Sest. §69 (quoted in explan. n.) we have
eius (which may be the true reading here), falsely corrected to suae by
some copyists, and omitted after magis by others). 3. quaesivit for
quaerunt, ST. 4. planius, ST, and two Mss. Lagom.; plane, F. ;
planus in some old edd. 3 A. Gellius, xvi. 7. 10, says that it occurs in the
pro'Cluentz'o. 6. spe, om. T. 10. condidisset, ST; condivisset,
R, and edd. condisses is Baiter’s conjecture. 11. sese ab opp.
destitutum, condemned by Madv. (Append. aa( Dz’sp. de Ascon. p. 51 seq.) 3
Kays. brackets, and also suspects pulchre‘adseverat and atque; but
surely the former is too good for an interpolator. 12. cum, STFM 3
quam, some inferior MSS. , Lamb., Or. Cp. 568, n.
