v. 12] CRITICAL NOTEs. 223

latter reading may seem the more symmetrical, answering to contra
damnatum et mortuum. But the repetition of the preposition really
contributes to the clearness of the antithesis: incolumi et vivo might
readily be taken for one of Cicero’s duplicate phrases, in which the idea
conveyed by two words is a single one. Just below (1. 26) the preposition

’ is similarly repeated: cp. ἓ 3, 1. 5 n.: a writer is apt to fall into the

same form of expression twice: cp. ἓ 9, l. 7, with ἓ 10, l. 18. 24. hic

accedere, R, Or.‚ Lamb. (writing accidere), Ry. Here offensio evidently
means a ‘ blow in the shape of an adverse judgment,’ damnatio. There-
fore Classen’s objection against the latter reading, that accederet implies
Cluentius had already suffered a similar reverse, is conclusive.

Lambinus read convicta, Graevius convincta (which he thought he

proved by Plzz‘l. v, ἓ 20, and other ref. V. commentary. 12. in omni
causa, ST, cod. Lamb., Class„ Bait.‚ Kays, Miill.‚ Kl. ; nominis causa,
R, Or„ Ry. Quintilian (Declam. ccclxxxviii. p. 790) omits. Nominis
causa can only be defended on the principle ‘potior lectio difficilior.’
Ry. defends it on three other grounds : (1) ⁴ Although the expression “ in
omni causa,⁷' in the sense of “in tota hac causa '' may be defended, this
use of omnis is rare, especially in Cic.' (2) ‘ Nominis causa affords a plain
and satisfactory meaning.’ (3) ‘ In the first part of the sentence Cic. takes
credit, as it were, for his forbearance in consenting, even for form's sake,
to give her the appellation of mother, and then adds that this forbearance
on his part will in reality tend to make her guilt appear more odious.’
Argument (1) is nugatory, for the occasional use of omnis-:totus is not “
denied. Cp. ἓ 1, 1. 1, explanatory note : and add to the exx. there Rosc.
Am. ἓ 143, haec omnis oratio. Arguments (2) and (3) may be taken
together. Nominis causa could not mean ‘ for form’s sake ' (dicis causa).
If we are to accept it, Orelli's interpretation (ap. Classen) is the true one :
‘ quam aliter nominare non possim,' ‘ for want of a better name.' Then

’ the enim of 1. 15 is decisive against this reading. For Cic. is made to

say, ‘ 1 will call her mother, because I do not know what else to call the
relationship (it adheres to her through all) : fhr the name of mother is
the most effective which I can select for my purpose—to excite your
horror.' Also the repetition of mater in the first part is pointless unless
it is more than a ‘ name.' With in omni causa. all is clear and coherent.
Ernesti and Lemaire bracket the words nominis causa, regarding them as
taken from naturae nomen. 18. iudicabitis, S. 20. neque: quo
