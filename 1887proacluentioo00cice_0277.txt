LXIX. 195] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 213

The route may be traced 011 any map ; she would pass through Bovianum
and Aesernia, join the via Latina at Venafrum, and so travel to Rome:
v· Ramsay’s note. 31. Aquinum and Fabraterna‚ on the via Latina,
are respectively only eleven and seven miles from Arpinum, Cicero’s
birth-place. 31. quod . . . audivi, ‘about which I heard ἰ audio
with acc. here=‘hear the story of,' audio de. So not unfrequently:
Hor. C. i. 2. 23, audiet pugnas vitio parentum Ι rara iuventus: Marcell.
ἓ 28, pugnas innumerabiles, incredibiles victorias, monumenta, munera,
triumphos audientes et legentes tuos. By a kind of abbreviation in
thought, the thing itself is substituted for the account of it.

· 193.—Page 74, l. 4. dicam, future: cp. ἓ 51, quod timide dicam,
note. 8. consistendi potestas, ‘ in no town was she allowed to make a
halt! Sest. ἓ 113, quibus 1110 111 genere conductarum contionum consis-
tendi potestas non fuit, with a slightly different sense, ‘ who could not hold
their own in packed meetings like those‚' cp. ἓ 108, consistere indicendo.
9. contagionem aspectus, ‘ her baleful glauce.'

194.—-12. nostrorum, gen. pl. of nos, v. crit. n. 13. fidem,
‘integrity.’ For other meanings v. ἓ 3 11. 15. occultiora: for the
comparative cp. ἓ 162, alienior, ‘ a perfect stranger.’ So here, ‘ which she
imagines to be a great secret.' 17. neque intellegit, cet. ‘not per-
ceiving that the favour of Heaven may be gained by devotion to duty
towards man and towards God, and by righteous prayers, not by polluted
superstition and sacrifices offered that crime may prosper.'

PERORATION OF THE SPEECH.

LXIX. 195.-22. quasi aliquos (1605, ‘whom fortune has appointed
to play the part of another Providence to Cluentius' (P). V. crit. n.
(Why ‘fortune’? An allusion to the sortitio.) 24. importumtatem,
‘accursed rage ': cp. ἓ 170, 31111111 importunitatem, and Gloss. ‘Many
have ere now deferred to their pity for the fathers in judging the sins
of the children: we ask you not to surrender to the heartlessness of his
mother in dealing with my client’s most honourable past.' The antithesis
is verbal rather than real, peccata misericordiae concesserunt, honestissime
actam vitam crudelitati condonetis .· so far well, but parentum is not
related to mis. as matris to crud. ; the genitives are differently used.
Cp. a similar antithesis‚⁶§ 5 ad fin. 25. concesserunt ε cp. Prov. Cons.
ξ 44, 1116 dolorem et inimicitias meas rei publicae concessisse, ‘ have waived
in consideration of the public interest.’ For condonetis cp. ἓ 109, 11011
sibi ac defensioni suae condonatum esse Opp„ ‘ had been pardoned in
compliment to.' Here ‘ sacrifice to.’ 27. praesertim cum z cp. n. on
ἓ 103. 30. studio frequentiaque, ‘ by their partisanship and presence
in force ’: answering to ἓ 197, 11116 frequentes adesse et hunc frequentes
laudare. Pago 75, 1. 1. non domesticis . . . tutum: v. crit. n.
