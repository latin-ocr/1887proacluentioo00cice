1. 4] EXPLANATORY NOTEs. 81

balanced in Greek by μὲν . . δέ . . . There is no antithesis (6 on the
one hand . . . on the other hand . . . ’) between the clauses ut quaeratis,
ut non existimetis cet. ; the latter is simply a nse-statement of the former.
To say that the whole task of refutation is left to the advocate [omnem‚
cp. n. ’ἓ 1, l. 1] is to say in other words that the defendant is to be credited
with innocence to the exact amount to which the defence shall entitle him,
and to neither more nor less [non plus . . quam quantum cet. ].--So a colon
is wanted at potuerit instead of the full stop which appears in most edd.
18. oratore here has its archaic sense, ‘ spokesman,’ zze. ‘ advocate‚' patro-
nus : being a verbal subst. from oro, which meant ‘ to speak for another’
or ‘plead.' Orare antiquos dixisse pro agere testimonio sunt oratores,
Fest. p. 198, Mull. ; cp. also Donatus on Ter. Hec., 'orator est is cui causa
defendenda mandatur: V. L. and Sh. sub voc. οναίον,ὀνο. 21. inter
vos, v. crit. n. 23. agunt, cp. ἕ 77, agi fortunas omnium dicebat:
Sest. ἓ 103, populus libertatem agi putabat suam ι ‘is concerned.’
-› Pago 2, 1. 4. ‘In the one part of the case we must enlist your vigilance
'⁴ “ in our cause: in the other we must throw ourselves upon your chiv alrous
“ feeling. ’ unigentio. and fides are often associated, as in ἓ 118. Here dili
gentia is ‘careful attentionss ‘scrutiny of the charges made’ 3fldes, the
sense of honour which prompts a man to protect one who is placed at an
unfair disadvantage by prejudice. Cp. Sex. Rosc. §27, eius virtute, fide,
diligentia factum est ut hic potius vivus in reos quarn occisus in proscrip-
tos referretur, of Caecilia, who had harboured Roscius from his enemies.
For fides in the concrete sense of a warrant of protection, we may com-
pare the phrase fides'publz‘ca‚ a ‘passport.’ 5. sine vestro ac s1ne
talium virorum subsidio: the statement might be purely general—‘no
one could combat prejudiee without your aid or the aid os jurors like you.’
‘But in many passages in Cicero tales viri or lcz‘ tales viri denotes the
=jury sitting sor the time being (chz'nct. ἐξ 53, 81 ; Sex. Rosc. ξ 54; Divz‘n.
,ἓν in Caec. § 51 3 Verr. ii. 1. 103 cp. de Orat. ii. ἓ 364, de domo, ἓ 3); and
ἶ the presumption from usage is strong in favour of another rendering,
λζ ‘without your aid, that is, without the aid of this honourable court.'
595, ‘ sine vestra sapientia ac sine iudiciorum remediis' is very similar.
δέ. ’ Αεέρρεηᾶε a nearer definition of vestro: cp. its use in Livy's ‘viri
ac Romani’ (vii. 13. 9 3 xxii. 14. 11). The repetition of the preposition

 

. need not be a difficulty-cp. ξ 4, in aliqua perniciosissima flamma atque in
communi incendio ; ξ 17, in communibus hominum sensibus atque in ipsa
*natura V. crit. n. here and on ἓ 141.

4—6. quo me vertam nescio. The passage is quoted by Quintilian
252* and Romanus Aquila as an example of the rhetorical figure called διαπό-
ῑῗῑ ρησις (dubztatzo), an assumed hesitation. Cornificius says (iv. 29. 40),
‘dubitatio est, quom quaerere videtur orator, utrum de duobus potius
aut quid de pluribus potissimum dicat? 8. esse. ..agitatam Cic.
ζ· constantly places the auxiliary before its participle at an interval of more
than one word. sz ἓ 1, l. 6. There is no contrast here of present
