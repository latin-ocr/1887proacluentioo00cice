of the higher magistrates. (a) Thus, as commissioners of police, they
assisted the aediles: in this capacity they patrolled and kept order in
the streetS, arresting and summarily punishing disorderly characters
(Hor. Epod. iv, 11, sectus flagellis hic triumviralibus): and also
superintending all precautions against fire. (b) In the other important
· branch of their functions they are the subordinates of the praetors
(with whom, for the earlier period, we must here associate the
consuls as judicial officers). (Ι) In criminal jurisdiction they have no
independent powers: they may arrest accused persons and detain them
till a higher magistrate interferes: they may entertain at their tribunal,
the Columna Maenia in the Forum (near the common prison), any accusa-
tion preferred, and set an investigation on foot. (This we find Q. Manlius
doing in the present case.) They are also (like our Sheriffs) responsible
for the execution of a capital sentence: in the case of private execution
by strangling‚ they are themselves the proper executioners ε so in the case
of the Catilinarian conspirators, Sall. Cat. 55. Hence their title capitales.
(2) In civil jurisdiction the triumvirs were competent to try certain cases
remitted to them, with instructions, by the praetor acting in iure as it
was called. But they could not pass a capital sentence: and. the quaes-
tiones perpetuae in course of time absorbed their judicial functions.1

Nullus with the abl. is used for ‘without,’ without the usual cum os
