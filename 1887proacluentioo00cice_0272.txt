208 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [LXV. 182

an. 27. eui probatus? ‘to whom will your story commend itself?’
V. Gloss. 28. ‘ Is there anything that you could bring forward more im-
probable?’ V. crit. n. 30. atque etiam incensa, cet. A summary
of the preceding part of the section will explain the sequence here. ‘ An
inquiry was set on foot with regard to the theft. So at least every one
must suppose, considering what were the circumstances immediately
preceding, the ransacking of the chest, the murder of the slaves, etc.
Most improbable that it should have been about anything else. There is
another circumstance (dez'nde): was it likely that an inquest would be
held on O-pp. three years after his death? Well, not only was such an
inquest held, but (atque etiam) once more she demanded Nicostratus for
examination.' Thus atque etiam . . . postulavit is the answer to quaere-
batur? 32. Postea, cum, a necessary correction for postea quam of
the MSS„ which cannot be proved ever to take the subj. construction in
Cicero. V. crit. n.

LXV. 182.—Page 70, 1. 4. de quibus servis quaestio habebatur: the
verbal subst. has the same construction as the verb3 cp. ἓ 176, de hoc
Stratone . . . quaesituram esse dixit. Quaero de or ex aliquo is used of
examination by torture (though by no means exclusively) : quaero ab aliquo
is the more ordinary construction. Cp. Rosc. Am. ἓ 120, si quaeritur de Sex
Roscii servis, non in dominum quaeritur : contrast z’b. ἓ 73, quaero abs te,
C. Eruci, quo modo. 5. credo parenthetical is almost always ironica] ε
‘ Ι dare say,' ‘ very likely.’ 7. Itane tandem? derisive, ‘is it really
so?' ἄληθες; 8. morbo, animi: so vooos=madness. Compare Hor.
Serm. ii. 3. 79, quisquis luxuria tristive superstitione Ι aut alio mentis
morbo calet; Tusc. iii. ξ 7, misereri invidere gestire laetari, haec omnia
morbos Graeci appellant, motus animi rationi non obtemperantis, where “
he proceeds to say that the more usual term in Latin is perturbatio. V.
crit. n. on this sentence. 12. non dicam nullo viro . . . sed nullo
bono viro : ‘ I will not say no man whatever, but no respectable man.’
Non dicam (or non modo) . . . sed is often thus used where the speaker
expressly rejects a stronger and wider in favour of a more limited and
cautious assertion. Sest. ξ 108, quis non modo ad probavit sed non
indignissimum facinus putavit illum non dicam loqui sed vivere ac spirare ?
Plane. ἓ 78 (Holden). ne colonum . . . dicatis, referring to the
paramour of Sassia, Sex. Albius (ἓ 175), who, it is distinctlyimplied, was
present at this examination. He is again referred to in ἐ 185, neminem
[qui obsignarit] reperietis, nisi forte eiusmodi hominem, quem ego proferri
malim quarn neminem nominari. We must take Cicero’s word sor the
worthlessness of this man’s testimony.

183.--15. tametsi ab hoe non esse hoc dictum mementote: v. crit. n.
for variants and explanation of this clause : ab lzoczab Accio. 17. Hoc
uno modo, cet., ‘ gentlemen, thus and thus only many a time does truth
list up her head, which the villainy of numbers has long held down, thus
does the defence of the innocent, long stifled thereby, draw breath again.'
