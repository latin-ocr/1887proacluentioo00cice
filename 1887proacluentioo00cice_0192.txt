128 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XXIV. 66

66.—21. Repetam . . . alt-ius, n. on alte petito, ξ, 58; cp. Plin. Ep.

8. 8, ne longius exempla repetamus, ‘ not to go far afield for instances.’
22. ‘That you shall fancy you are witnessing them with your own eyeS‚’
videamini, sc. vobis. A common ellipse: hence videri can often be
translated ‘ feel ἐ Verg. A. v. 231 :

hos successus alit : possunt quia posse videntur.

26. esse videatur: Cicero ended his sentences so frequently with these
words that the mannerism attracted the ridicule of his contemporaries,
and the imitation of the young rhetoricians of a later day. Cp. Tac. Dial.
de Orator. xxiii„ illud tertio quoque sensu (‘ in every third sentence ’l in
omnibus orationibus pro sententia positum ‘ esse videatur'; Quint. Χ. 2.
18, noveram quosdam qui se pulchre expressisse genus illud caelestis
huius in dicendo viri sibi viderentur, si in clausula posuissent ‘esse
videatur.' Cp. endings of ἐξ 118, 125. (On the favourite rhythms, cp.
Potts, L. Pr. Comp. pp. 97-99.) 32. cupidiore, ‘more partial':
cp. the phrase omnia alicui (alicuius causa) cupere. So de Or. ii. ἕ 129,
utimur facetiis in testem stultum cupidum levem 3 Caec. ἓ 8, cupidior
quam sapientem iudicem esse aequum est. But we might take it in the
sense which it certainly bears in ἓ 152 (sine cupiditate=integritate)‚

. ‘ desirous of gain‚’ ‘ grasping,' ‘ mercenary.'

67,-Page 26, 1. 2. ne sua quidem sententia liberatus: cp. §62
alter etiam ipse se condemnavit: and the account in ἐξ 58, 59. aeri-
oribus, ‘more drastic‚' opp. to leniora. Celsus, vi. 6. 14, acria medica-
menta, opp. to lenia 3 ib. vi. 6. 1, minus acrem curationem. (H. N. ap. P.)
7. capiti ac fortunis, a standing formula sor the complex of a man's
social and political rights. If he were capite deminutus, he had suffered
the curtailment of these. There were three degrees of capitis deminutio .·
maxima, the loss of personalfreedom, which involved the loss of citizen·
ship; minor, the loss of full Roman citizenship, whether by assumption
of the citizenship of another state, or by voluntary exile followed by aquae
et ignis interdictio (which made the exercise of Roman rights at Rome
impossible); minima, by adoption into another family. (V. Ry. Rom.
Ant. pp. 84, 85.) Thus a man’s caput comprised three thingS,—lz’bertas‚
civitas, familia.

XXV.—-—8. Iam: introducing a general truth, as in ἓ 46 (ubi v.
crit. n.), ἓ 57. 9. monitae, ‘reminded': the original sense of the

word, which is a causative from »smam to think (in mens, memini ; Μοῦσαι,
the goddesses who bring the past to the poet's mind): its subst. is
monumentum, as in Verg. A. ν. 538, monumentum et pignus amoris.
68.—-11. causam bonorum Safini Atellae, a cause ce'lebre of the day,
known as the iudicium Safinianum (ἓ 99) to Cicero’s hearers. We can
only conjecture what it was. Safinius was a pupillus or ward, whose
property had (apparently) been allowed by his guardians to come to a
forced sale, owing to encumbrances upon it. He seems to have sued his
