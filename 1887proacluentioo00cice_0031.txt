INTRODUCTION. xxiii

was it long before he found a lady whose ‘fine sympathies
and resolute spirit' (humanitas constantiaque, ἓ 26), as well
as her not inconsiderable fortune, singularly attracted him.
Sassia did not reject the advances of her husband's murderer :

ν she merely expressed some reluctance to undertake the

responsibilities of a stepmother: an obstacle which Oppianicus
succeeded in overcoming by the speedy removal of two of
the obnoxious children. A third, however, his son by Magia,
lived to evince his gratitude to his father for his life by taking
up his cause against Cluentius in this prosecution.

The category of Oppianicus' crimes thus far committed is
not complete without the mention of the murder of his
brother C. Oppianicus, and his brother's wife, then in her preg-
nancy, as also the murder of Asuvius of Larinum. The motive
of these crimes also was lust for gain. The last mentioned
nearly brought him into serious trouble: he was actually
seized and brought before the tribunal of Q. Manlius,
triumvir capitalis at Rome, but escaped by bribing him to
discharge him. We cannot at this point abstain from an
expression of surprise that Oppianicus had not been brought to
justice before this for some of his previous crimes. If Cicero
is not (as his words in g 10 might seem to imply) blackening
the character of the dead in order the more easily to white-
wash the living, we can only suppose that in the general disorder
of the period of the Social War and Sulla⁷s proscriptions the
irregularities of Oppianicus had been overlooked. But some
of them belong to an earlier period.

§5- A. Cluentius Habitus, the present defendant, is now
brought into direct collision with his stepfather Oppianicus,
by no fault of his own, if we are to believe Cicero, who now
proceeds to the ‘probabile ex causa‚' or argument based on
the probable motives which Oppianicus may have had for
wishing to murder his stepson. One of these is the insatiate
avarice of Oppianicus, who hoped through his mother Sassia
to become the possessor of his property. Another is the
personal dislike which he felt towards him, because he had
asserted, in opposition to himself, the rights of the muni-
cipality of Larinum in the matter of the college of Martiales,
denying that they were free Roman citizens.

These suggested motives seem inadequate, the latter
particularly. But the former also presupposes a good deal.
First, an intention of murdering Sassia. One murder more
or less may have been nothing to Oppianicus. But when
