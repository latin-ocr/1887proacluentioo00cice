in default,’ ‘reversionary heirs‚' to whom the property went in case the
heir, who was first named in the will (primo gradu scriptus), did
not, from whatever cause, take the property. A heres secundus was in
fact a heres substitutus: there might also be a heres substitutus tertio,
quarto, gradu, and so on. Cp. Hor. Serm. ii. 5. 48, of a legacy·hunter:

heres et, si quis casus puerum egerit Orco,
in vacuum venias.

19. damno is construed most commonly with either the Gen. or Abl. of
the charge or the penalty: ἓ 114, damnatos ambitus : ἓ 19, criminibus
damnatus. The Gen. of the penalty is all but confined, however, to the
words capitis, pecuniae, capitalis poenae. R. 1325 and 1200, r. 527, 495.
In damnare octupli cet. we have the Locative. Here, rei capitalis is
Gen. of the charge or crime. Cp. n. on ξ 97. 20. heredem familiae:
v. Gloss. familia. 22. in eadem iniuria, lit. ‘in the case of the

be punished in O.' (P.) The prep. z'n is often employed with great preg-
nancy of meaning, which its English equivalent ⁴ in' is quite inadequate
to express. Cp. 1. 25, in singulis hominibus, ‘in the person of an indivi-
dual ' 3 ἓ 51, etiam si z'n minus firmis hominum causis non defuissem, ‘in

XII. 33.—31. adhibitis amicis ε 3 good illustration of a principle which
runs through much Roman law, public as well as private. A magistrate or
a paterfamilias is legally competent in virtue of his potestas to give a cer·
tain decision or perform a certain act without the participation of others.
But he is held to be morally bound, on important occasions, not to act
until he has taken the advice of competent persons, who, called in to ad-
vise, constitute his consilium. Thus for a certain class of actions, the
magistrate must advise with the senate as the publicum consilium: the
jury (consilium) in a criminal process stands technically in the same
relation to the praetor or quaesitor ε similarly in important domestic acts,
such as divorce or the capital punishment of a son, relations and friends of
the house appear to have been summoned to give their advice. In leg. agr.
