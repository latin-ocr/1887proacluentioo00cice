ANALYSIS.

By J. A. HAMILTON.

EXORmuM.

CH. I. (ξ 1) The speech for the prosecution was in two parts 3 the
first resting on the prejudice about Oppianicus' trial ;
the second dealing with the nature of charges of
poisoning. ’

(ξ 2) Ι shall follow the same order, treating the second head
shortly, but the first, which is fitter for a ‘contio'
than a trial, at length. (§§ 3, 4) But I rely on you,
gentlemen 3 as to the prejudice, I know you are men

ῙΙ- of the world, and (§§ 5, 6) you will give me a fair
hearing.

ΙΙΙ, (ἕὲ 7, 8) It is hard to have lain under this prejudice eight
years, but a fair trial is a safeguard, and 1 hope it
will end here, if you will deal with it impartially.

Ι.

 

IV. (ξ 9) The source of all the prejudice is the charge that ξ’

Cluentius bought a verdict of Guilty against Oppi· ⁴
anicus. I shall show (a) that his guilt was clear, ³¹
(b) that the jury was bound to convict‚ (c) that the
bribery took place on Oppianicus’ side, not Cluentius’.

A.—OPP1AN1cth’ CRIMES.

(ἓ 10) What were Oppianicus’ crimes? (ξ 11) Cluentius ᾖ·
prosecuted not from a mere desire to figure as a pro· ἱ.

secutor, but because he was driven to do so by in· ’

famous· wrongs. 1 must be detailed. 3
V. Cluentius the elder died 88 B.C., leaving my client, then ,

fifteen years old, and a daughter, who shortly after
married A. Aurius Melinus, her first cousin (ξ 12).
But Sassia, her mother, became enamoured of Melinus Γ

(ξ 13), and pursued him with her passion. The
daughter confided her trouble to Cluentius (ἓ 14). ζ’

Melinus suddenly divorced his wife and married ᾗ
Sassia (ἓ 15).
