κινῇ. 132] EXPLANATORY NOTEs. 175

XLVII. 13o.—25. ventum . . . quaesitum: cp. ξ 77, omnes . . .
ventos colligere, with n. The picture is that of a yachtsman shifting his
sails to catch any breeze that he can. 29. illa iudicia, senatoria ξ, 61,
with n. 30. notatione tabellarum ε this ‘ marking of the voting tablets '
had occurred at the trial of Terentius Varro de repetundis, B.C. 75, at which
his kinsman Hortensius had defended him, and had kept the bribed jurors
to their promises by providing them with tablets so marked or coloured
that they could afterwards be identified. Cp. Divin. in Caec. ἓ 24, cera-
tam uni cuique tabellam dari cera legitima, non illa infami ac nefaria:
Verr. i. ξ 17, ἓ 40, ut discoloribus signis iuratorum nominum sententiae
notarentur: and elsewhere. erat in iudiciis . . . 1nv1dia versata:
cp. ἓ 8, error in hac causa atque invidia versata est. We invert in trans-
lating: ‘ the jury courts had again been the object of violent ill-feeling.’
32. homines, the antecedent of quos is the accus. case, taken up by eos z
cp. ἓ 115, ea diligentia quae . . . eadem . . . adhibita est. The subject
to voluerunt is censores: the same subject as to viderentur . . . repre-
hendisse. Pago 50,1. 2. 1110 ipso tempore, 13.c. 70, date of the
censorship of Lentulus and Gellius (v, ἓ 117) and of the lex Aurelia.
mis censoribus: iseo magis quod . . . introduced the reason as a sub-
jective one, i.e. as present to the minds of the censors, we should have
essent, not erant, and se, not illis. But the reason is objective z i.e. it is
the reason assigned by Cicero on his own authority.

131.—7. habuisse, sc. tum cum subscripserunt. 8. ex . . .
subscriptione . . . esse quaesitum, ‘their act . . . had been simply
a bid for popular applause and acclamation.’' The metaphor is that
of a commercial transaction: ex (as often de) denoting that a draft is
made upon a certain sund: cp. Verr. ii. 3. 119, delectetur quod tanto
plus sibi mercedis ex fundo refectum sit. For quaero, prop. ‘to make
money,’ cp. ἓ 70, mihi . . . quid quaeretur? rumor, here ‘ap-
plause ’ : cp. n. on rumusculos, ἓ 105. 10. subscribo, as we see here,
denotes properly the assignment of the reason for the nota, not the affixing
of the nota. V. on this ἓ 126, crit. n. on reliquisse subscripserunt.
11. quo innocentem condemnaret: on quo final without a comparative,
v. n. on ἓ 9, where it is similarly used. 12. divinationis ι cp. n. on §97.
14. ut. nihil dicam : a final sentence, giving the purpose not of the action
itself, butof the mention of the action. Cp. n. on ἓ 85, 1. 18; R. 1660,
r. 690.

132.—16. The terms are chosen significantly : condemnat . . . iudicat,
‘ finds a true bill against P. . . . gives his verdz‘ct (if you will have it so)':
as if a subscriptio were a iudicium. 17. Negat hoc Lentulus : as we
said in n. on ἓ 122, the formal co-operation of both censors was necessary
in order that the nola might take effect. The case of Popilius, as here re-
presented, is not inconsistent with this: both censors removed him from
the senate, though giving different reasons in their subscriptiones for the
proceeding. There is an exaggeration contained in negat z Lentulus had
