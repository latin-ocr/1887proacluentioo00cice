xxii INTRODUCTION.

Cicero does not make nearly so much of Oppianicus' cruelty to
his wives as he might have done ε even the expression quoted
above from§ 52 is not his own, but that of P. CannutiuS, who
opposed him on the trial of Scamander. In fact Cluentia is
the only one of whose end he gives us precise information.

Oppianicus then was about this time charged with the
murder of his brother-in-law, M. Aurius, son of Dinaea, a
wealthy lady of Larinum, and brother of Magia.1 Of her
children, Num. Aurius, Magia, Cn. Magius successively died;
another, M. Aurius, taken prisoner in the Social War and sold
into slavery, was supposed to be long since dead. Impelled·
by insatiate avarice, Oppianicus first secured the reversion
of the inheritance of Cn. Magius to his son by Magia, by
taking practical steps to prevent the accomplishment of the
testator's desire to bequeath it to his posthumous son. Then,
when the long-lost M. Aurius was reported to be safe and
sound, though in captivity‚ and his mother in her lonely old
age rejoiced to think that fortune had spared her one of her
children, this bold and wicked man made short work with
her dreams of happiness, One of his agents, L. Clodius, a
travelling quack, removed Dinaea by a short and sharp
‘illness⁷ (as it is called in ἓ 22: cp. ἕ 40 for a less ironical
account) 3 another bribed the informant of Dinaea to mislead
her friends, who were searching the country for M. Aurius 3
and another assassinated M. Aurius, to whom the unfortunate
mother had left a large legacy, bequeathing, however, the bulk
of her property to Oppianicus the younger (son of Oppianicus
and Magia). Thus Oppianicus after a judicious manipulation
of Dinaea's will, found himself (through his son) sole heir to
the whole property of the unfortunate family whose happiness
he had wrecked, and in whose deaths <it is implied in ἓ 40,
quo [medico Oppianici] curante suos omnes perdidisset) he
had had a hand. He had now however to reckon with the
friends and relatives of M. Aurius, and had to save his life
by a hasty retreat to the camp of Q. Metellus, who was acting
for Sulla against the Marians. He returned to Larinum
invested with the authority of Sulla to punish those towns-
people who had taken what was now the vanquished side:
and proscrihed and put to death his enemies, among them
A. Aurius MelinuS, husband of Sassia.
