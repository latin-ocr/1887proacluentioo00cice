136 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XXV111.77

ib. ξ 83, 111 10111 publicam animo ; ib. ξ 91, res ad communem utilitatem ;
z‘b. ἓ 131, ad urbem accessus . . . iter a porta ; de Offi i. 543, pecuniarum
translatio a iustis dominis ad alienos. The usage is not unfrequent any-
where when the subst. is a verbal noun and takes the construction of its
verb, or when the connection is closer, as in expressions of the types,
summum in rem publicam studium, Ciceronis in rem publicam studium.
Exx, of the looser usage are frequent in Livy. 22. suspicio, sc. eum
pecunia oppugnatum esse. primo :prima actione (MAN.); for the
meaning of which v. n. 011 ἓ 55, l. 5. Contrast ξ 106, paulo posterius
patefacta re. Mr. Nettleship quotes Verr. ii. 1. 26, ‘non primo iudicare 'z
opp. ampliare, Liv. xliii. 2. 6, bis ampliatus, tertio absolutus est reus.
23. Cp. ἐξ 106, 107. We shall find reason to conclude that nine voted
N. L.. five A. (not guilty), eightecn C. (guilty). 24. qul hoc
statuerunt, v. crit. n. hoc : sc. they were confident in the justice of a
pure motive, although others (Bulbus, Staienus, etc.) were known 'to
have voted in the same way from a corrupt motive. 27. ‘ Five in all.’
30. ambitione : ‘ by interested motives.' Cp. ἓ 108, qui absolvit, ambi-
tiosus. Staienus had undertaken all Oppianicus’ bribing for him, and
had appropriated the lump sum intrusted to him. Therefore ambitio can
here hardly imply a positive bribe. Indeed, it is doubtful if it could bear
that meaning in Cic.‚ who uses ambitus thus. ‘ The only bad sense am·
bitio has is ‘ political jobbery,’ Reid on Sull. ξ 4. It is remarkable that
Cic. does not venture to hint at any bribery in the case of those who voted
N. L., or those who acquitted.

77.—31. Cp. Liv. xxii. 26. 4, haud parum callide auram favoris popularis
ex dictatoria invidia petiit. So ἓ 130, ventum popularem esse quae-
situm; § 131 (which explains the expression), rumorem quendam et ’
plausum popularem esse quaesitum 3 Hor. C. iii. 2. 19, nec sumit aut ponit
secures Ι arbitrio popularis aurae. [‘ Quinctius, a man devoted above
everything to the people, one who had set himself to catch every breeze
produced by town talk or popular meetings.'-H. J. R.] Q. laid himself
0111 10 be popular, ‘ filled his sails ' (Ρ.) with the breath of the ‘ vox populi.'

Pago 30, l. 1. invidia senatoria, v. n. on ἕ 68, l. 17, for the use of the
adj. ; cp. Liv. l.c. 2. ‘ He addressed the people in one or two forcible and
severe speeches.' 3. vehemens et gravia, one of Cicero’s favourite dupli·
cate expressions :so Catil. i. § 3, senatus consultum in te vehemens et grave.
contiones is used in ἓ 127 111 1110 same sense : V. Glossary. 5. agl, cp. ἓ 3,
agitur in criminibus A. Cluenti proprium periculum: ‘ are at stake.’
nulla. esse iudicia, ‘ fair trial was a thing of the past.’ So Ov. Her. x.
11—Ariadne waking finds Theseus gone—‘ nullus erat, referoque manus,
iterumque retempto, Ι perque torum moveo bracchia, nullus erat' 3 Sall.
Hist. Fr. i., (Lepidi oratio) quies et otium cum libertate . . . nulla sunt.

hominem, quamvis sit nocens, neminem posse damnari. 8. virum . . .
