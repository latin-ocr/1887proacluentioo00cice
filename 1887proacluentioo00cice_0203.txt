xxx. 83] EXPLANATORY NOTEs. 139

hibenda),’ ‘ Bribery was powerless to avert a conviction—much less was

tation to the plurality of persons addressed. So Demosth. uses ι’δέ ; cp. also
Dem. Phil. i. ἓ 10, ἢ βούλεσθε, εἰπέ μοι, περιιόντες αὐτῶν πυνθάνεσθαι ; so in
§197. 7. profectio=unde profecta sit, 1. 28 supra. Generally applied to
persons: it is verbal subst. ofproficiscor‚ which, analysed into its elements
[pro-‚fic-, root of facio, i-sc·0—r]‚ means ‘ I begin to make (myself) forward,’
εἰ. ‘I start.' 8. ‘ Has kept his account-books in a most business-like way.'
Commentators deride this argument, and say that Cluentius would never
have booked his bribes as such. But, to say nothing of the difficulty of
accounting sor a disbursement of 640,000 sesterces under the head of
ordinary expenditure, the jurors would no more be startled into incredulity
by an appeal to the ledger of a paterfamilias in evidence, than the
assessors of income-tax are when a merchant submits his books in evi-
dence of the amount of his income. ‘A creditor's account-books were
admitted in law courts as evidence of a debt under some circumstances '
(Wilkins on de Orat. ii. §97). On the care with which a Roman kept
his accounts v. de Orat. l.e. and Verr. ii. 1. 60, audimus aliquem numquam

(with note). Here the present is the same perfect-present which appears
with iamdudum and other adverbs of duration. R. 1723, r. 727. 13. cum
interea . . . iuven-stim here, as in ἓ 28, cum=et tum, and expresses
the coincidence in time of two events or facts, whereas in ll. 10 and 11
supra it expresses the co-extension of two lengths of time. Cp. R. 1733,
r. 735, for examples of cum interim, cum interea, thus used: ‘ For eight
long years the case has exercised your thoughts, and you have hunted
up, turned oyer, and scrutinised everything that you could find in my
client's ledgers and those of other men bearing on the case3 and withal
you find not atrace of a bribe from Cluentius.' 15. vobis indicibus,

objection. So at, 1. 24. 20. cum 111 consutum iretur . . . cum tn
