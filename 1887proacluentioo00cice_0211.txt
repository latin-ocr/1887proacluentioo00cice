Gesetzgebung, Essen‚ 1882, p. 9). fraudi esse, a legal and archaic
phrase ‘ to damage.’ R. pref. to Book iv. p. xliv, r. 482 a. 15. With
similar irony Verres is addressed (Verr. ii. 1. 100) as lzomo castissimus.
16. subsortitionem: the jury on a criminal trial were appointed by lot,
and this process was termed sortitio: when a vacancy, from any cause,
occurred in a consilium, the place was filled up by a fresh drawing of lots‚
and this process was termed subsortitio—Ry. The vacancies (according
to MAN.) were made by the reiectio of prosecutor and defendant : but this
is unlikely : certainly the case of Fidiculanius Falcula, who was not pre-
sent from the beginning of the trial, was not of this kind. eius, made
by Junius: eo, that of Verres. Contrast with this passage Verr. ii. Ι.
157, 158, where Cic. refers to subsortitio illa Iuniana iudicum as a
notorious case of corrupt procedure, in which the praetor Verres was in
league with the iud. quaestionis Junius‚ and afterwards falsified his register,
fearing to share the fate of the latter—multos ex te viros primarios audisse
cum diceres ignosci tibi oportere quod falsum codicem protuleris3 nam
qua invidia C. Iunius conflagravit, ea, nisi providisses, tibi ipsi tum
pereundum fuisset. interlitUS, ‘ full of erasures ' z Verr. 1. c. ex-
plains the process: ‘referendo in tabulas . . . quod gestum non esset,
tollendo quod esset et semper aliquid demendo mutando interpolando.’
The clause is added to show that the evidence of Verres’ register was
worthless.

XXXIV. 92.-22. aliquam: v. crit. n. 23. si . . . erat: for the
indicatives cp. ἓ 85, in hoc si improbus Cethegus fuit. non, thus
used without a verb in an answer is very rare in Classical prose: Caec.
§ 33, quid? hoc Verre praetore factum est solum ? non, sed etiarn quaes-
tore Caecilio. It often occurs in the comie poets‚ and must have been collo-
quially much used. The alternative form of denial is that of Ter. Ad. iv, 2.
30, sed estne frater intus? Non est. So too of words sor ‘ yes,’ such as ita
and vero. In Greek, too, οὔ and ναί are much less common in the literary
language than their equivalents in modern languages. This is due partly
to the wealth of the classica] languages in particles‚ partly perhaps to the
tendency of the Greek mind to finesse and irony, and its avoidance of all
that is blunt in expression. 27. illud iudicium tuisse, ‘ that his (Junius')
trial wasone worthy the name.’ Below (1. 29) illud iudicium is Oppian-
icus' trial, the ‘iudicium Iunianum.' 30. ra-tio imus iudicii, the
‘motive’ of the trial of Junius. P. compares (from Demosth.) ἡ τοῦ
&stu-os· προαίρεσις. V. Gloss.

93.—Page 36, 1. 3. contiones: cp. Verr. i. ἓ 2, nuncin ipso discrimine
ordinis iudiciorumque vestrorum cum sint parati qui contionibus et legibus
hanc invidiam senatus inflammare conentur: referring to the agitation
against senatorial juries of which that against the iud. lunianum formed a
part. 4. Accusabat, equivalent to multam petivit, 591. 5. sub-
selua, iudicum, MAN. 6. Gradus 1111 Aurem tum novi, in the Forum
Romanum: probably the orator would point to them as he spoke. Cp. Flacc.
