priated moneys without having first been named in the litis aestimatio:
and there no one ever was named, save on the statements of witnesses
or from the books of private persons or the accounts of some community or
other, and so persons who had their fears usually appeared at the settling
of damages, and whenever they were expressly named, they spoke forth-
with in their own defence, if so inclined; or, if they feared to sace the
strong feeling of the time being, reserved their reply for a later occasion τ
and many after so doing came out triumphant.’ Refer to Prof. Nettle-
ship, Essays, p. 82, Ry. note on this passage, and Rom. Ant. p. 300.

aestimatae. Ry. objects to this sentence, thus read [ν. crit. n.], as
being ‘ completely at variance with the tenor of Cicero's observa-
tions. . . . Far from being an illustration of the careless leniency of
jurors, it would rather be a proof of vindictive persecution.' But Cic.
argues, not that jurors are always lenient in lit. aest„ but that they are
always careless, and that sometimes in the way of severity (as in the case
of Scaevola), sometimes in that of leniency. The leniency, of which
Ry. sees an additional proof in the next sentence (et hoc cotidie . . .),
was that of iudices in a iudicium, not of iudices in a lit. aest. It is because
jurors are negligent in a lit. aest. that this process does not carry the
weight of a iudicium: brought to the test of the latter, it sometimes
proves itself a ‘brutum fulmen': indeed the selfsame iudices acting in
iudicium will recant their own sentence given in lit. aest. Of the sen-
tence as he reads it, without maiestatis, Ry. offers no version at all.
15. Scaevola was condemned under the lex de repetundis before the
praetor Hortensius in B.C.72, for malversation in Apulia (aliis criminibus),
the fact that he had taken a bribe in the trial of Opp. being taken into
account by the jury in their litis aestimatio. 16. ‘ The utmost efforts
were made to have the damages brought in as capital.’ The interpreta-
tion of Manutius will not commend itself : ‘that this capital charge [lis
haec capitis, viz. maiestatis (?)—for tampering with jurors] with which S.
is now threatened, should be computed in a fine against him! 19. hac
