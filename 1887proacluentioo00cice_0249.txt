LI. 142] EXPLANATORY NOTES. 185

with the criticism of Quint. vi. 3. 20. We must not, however, expect to
find the words lepos and facetiae consistently distinguished : in de Orat. ii.
ἐξ 218, 220 they are synonymous. 9. ipse: v· crit. 11. 10. illius
accusatoris, ‘ of “the Prosecutor ” Brutus 3 ' v. n. on ἓ 140. 12. ruri,
a locative ε cp. dorni, humi, Carthagini, R. 1168, r. 485. 17. nequitia,
‘extravagance.' 19. quod si potuisset . . . non praeterisset: this
is a transition for the nonee to oratio recta. Cp. the converse in § 61,
l. 19, n. on quod . . . voluisset: andg 154, quibus z'n rebus . . . volue-

runt, a transition to or. recta. honeste, ‘with propriety.’ Ry.
quotes de Off i. ἓ 129, nostro quidem more cum parentibus puberes filii,
cum soceris generi non lavantur. id aetatis filio, ‘a son of that

age ’ t an acc. of duration of time used attributively. So id temporis, ‘ at
that time.' R. 1092, r. 460. 21. libris . . . tabulis . . . censu:
⁴ the books os Brutus in a literary sense, 1115 books in a mercantile sense, the
registration of his property, the books of the censor.’—Ry. 20. The
use of the balneum (balneae) instead of the simpler arrangements of earlier
times came in with other Hellenising fashions ; the word itself is Greek,
βαλανεῖον. The sing. generally denotes a private bath, the plur. a public
one, but neither use is invariable. Public baths were erected by the
community‚ or else (as those of Brutus) by a speculator, and then let out to
a lessee ; they were under the supervision of the aediles. Other instances
of baths belonging to speculators are the b. Seniae (Cael. ἓ 61), b. Palla-
cinae (Rosc. Am. ἓ 18). V. L. and Sh. balneum; Momms. Marq. Ro'm.
Alt. vii. 1. p. 265. 22. ultus est, ‘chastised.' De Orat. ii. ἓ 223
gives us a similar gibe, cum ille (Brutus) diceret se sine causa sudare,
‘minime mirum‚’ inquit, ‘ modo enirn existi de balneis ' : z'.e. ⁴ no wonder
you are perspiring, for you have just left (tle. parted with) your baths.’
25. ‘In which perhaps consistency is more required ’: magis quam in
κὴ, quae de re publica non sunt—MAN.

142.—25. Ego autem . . .: cp. n. on§ 139, sed errat vehementer . . .
Cic. is anxious, from a consciousness of the weakness of his position, to
dissociate it from politics. 28. oneriS, ‘responsibility': ista gives a
good sense, ‘the expressions which you quote against me’; cp. crit. 11.
31. fuisse in illa opinione populari, z‘.e. ‘that I accepted the current
opinion as my own ’ ε a larger admission than he professed himself ready
to make in ἓ 139, non ex mea opinione sed ex hominurn rumore. 33. ab
initio, ‘ at the beginning ’ : cp. Tac. Ann. i. 1, urbem Romama principio
reges habuere z and the use of unde in such passages as Hor. Epod. v. 85,
dubius unde rumperet silentium, ‘with what wordS‚’ lit. ‘starting from
what.'
