ANALYSIS. ’ xlix

Popilius and Q. Metellus, show: (ἓ 96) it was no trial,
but mere violence, and is not a judgment against
Cluentius.

Γ, ‚ (ἓ 97) 2d‚ Bulbus' conviction. That was sor maiestas,

’ζ not for his conduct in Oppianicus' case. Though
that was brought up against him there was plenty to
convict him for without it.

CH. XXXVI. (ξ 98) 3d, Popilius and Gutta: But they were convicted
de ambitu.

(ξ 99) 4tlz, Staienus: If his crime was not maiestas

(ἓ 100) his defence was that he got the money for

Cluentius, and it was laughed out of court. He was

proved to live by bribery. (ἓ 101) No ; the bribery

was brought home to Oppianicus, so Cluentius must

XXXVII. be innocent. (ἓ 103) Junius’ conviction was pro-
cured by violence, and the other cases make for us.

5ίΙι, Case of Falcula, who was a juror at the trial. He was
twice tried ε 1st‚ for informality in his appointment‚
and acquitted ; (ἓ 104) but I waive that3 2d‚ he
was tried de repetundis, and acquitted after a fair
trial.

XXXVIII. (§§ 105-106) Now, though the votes of those who acquitted

Oppianicus, however inconsistent, are excusable,

(ἓ 107) we find among those who did not aequit,

Octavius Balbus, Considius, Pedo, Mergus, Bas-

XXXIX. ilus, Caudinus, Cassius, Heius, Saturius. Herein

'‘15'- lay the difference between Junius' and Falcula's trial,

that in the former Quinctius prevented any defence :
and then on quitting office abandoned his agitation.

(ἓ 109) You remember him. It all grew out of his vexa-
tion at not getting Oppianicus off, as if having him
for an advocate was not most significant. (ἐξ 110
XL. and 111) He never defended a case before, and
was a mere demagogue, an unbridled ambitious
XLI. roturz'er. (ἓ 113) Falcula's acquittal at any rate
ι’,ιᾎ demolishes the argument of the prosecution : for he,
if any man, was bribed3 he convicted; he had not
sat out the case; so that either those who rely on
these trials must impeach thern or admit that
Oppianicus’ trial was a fair one; (ξ 114) but why
were the other jurors never put on their trial, and
why were those who were tried, not tried on this

l charge directly?
