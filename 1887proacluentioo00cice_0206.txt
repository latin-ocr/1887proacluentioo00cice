142 EXPLANATORY NOTES. [XXXI. 85

is the wisest man who strikes upon the right idea unprompted 3 and next
comes he who acts upon the happy thoughts of another.’ 5. ipsi: the
dat., not the gen., is always used in this phrase, the person being thus
kept more prominent. R. 1154, r. 480, B. Arn. § 257. The thing
recalled may appear in the gen. case, venit mihi Platonis in mentem, or
as a dependent clause or infin., R. 1332, r. 5293 infra, ἓ 122, qui
vobis in mentem venit haec appellare iudicia? ξ 183, mihi venit in
mentem quid dici possit. 10. eum faucibus premeretur, cp. iugulatum,
§ 68. faucibu8, abl. of ‘part concerned.’—R. 1210. sive, used
thus to attach not a sentence with its verb, but some member of
the sentence (eg. adverbial phrase); used, too, to <zo-ordinate, not
to subordinate, is not common. It generally appends, as here, a pre-
ferable alternative (sz·ve=sz·vep0tz·us) : Brut. ἓ 180, oratorum sive rabula-
rum. [Even with the other reading, sive does not introduce a fresh
sentence but an alternative expression for excogitavit] 11. Con·

ordinem, ‘ irregularly.' 18. adversarium3 perhaps (as P. suggests) in the
contest for the aedileship, v. ἓ 69, though it generally denotes an antago-
nist in a lawsuit, ag. in ἓ 120, qui inter adversarios convenisset. ‘ If
(as I grant) C. showed want of principle in this, I explain his conduct
by his desire to be rid of an opponent' (H. N. ap. 12.). Instead of
saying si . . . suit, . . . voluit (‘in being . ζ . he simply wished . . .’),
Cic. substitutes another apodosis, videtur voluisse: for the statement of
a fact he substitutes the fact of its statement by him. This and the
converse exchange are not uncommon. The converse exchange appears
in sentences prefaced by at enim (ξ 83, not ‘Staienus was' but ‘you
say that S. was'), in condemnarat cum praesertim . . . (ξ 103, n.),
in ξ 113, iam ergo aliquis . . . condemnavit, ‘I may assert that some
one condemned,' and ἓ 70, l. 13, the ‘elliptic' use of enim (as it is
called): ἓ 187, the similar use of nam. Also cp. ἓ 131 adfin., homines
sapientissimi, ut nihil dicam de eis . . . dixerunt,’ where ut gives the
purpose, not of the action (dixerunt) but of its mention. Cp. Hor.
Ep. i. 12. 25-
