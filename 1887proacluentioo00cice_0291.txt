only mean ‘who is there who could (now) imagine that he could (then)
have been acquitted? ' or perhaps ‘ could have imagined at that time that
he could be acquitted.' But for the latter rendering (alone in sense satis-
factory) Madvig's emendation posse arbitraretur is on syntactical grounds
indispensable. (Cp. his similar emendation in ἓ 133.) Edd. have gene-
’ rally (Bait.‚ Kays., Mun„ Kl.) preferred VVeiske’s conjecture potuisse
arbitretur, which is confirmed by one Laurentian codex (Classen's a), and
adapts itself better to the preceding quis est. A variant arbitrarentur for
arbitrentur appears in Caec. ἓ 5 : so too in ἐξ 96, 156 of this speech.

27.-—8. domum, omitted by several inferior codd. ; two of the Palatine
MSS. have dexteram according to Gruter, who suspects that the true read-
ing is some third word such as villam. Baiter, referring to ἓ 188, Aurium
Oppianici. esse opera proscriptum occisumque, finds additional reason sor
doubting the MSS. : Aurius perished neither by the hand nor in the house
of Oppianicus. But this is, as Ry. says, hypercriticism. Cicero is speak-
ing as an orator, not as a historian. The expression criticised is only a
more highly-coloured rendering of the words of ἓ 199, domum illam . . .
scelerum omnium affluentem. 10. se, om. T. fls, S 3 his, R.
11. domo is suspected by Pluygers as faulty alike in sense and syntax.
What Oppianicus did was to make room in his house by the murder of

r his sons, and this, according to Pluygers, is scarcely expressed by ‘domo
remedium quaerere ' ε he suggests continuo. Orelli also suspected corrup-
tion here, and suggested quoquo modo. 14. Pappia, ST. 16. Teano,
ST. Bait. brackets Apuli, which seems to be omitted by Arusianus
Messius, who quotes the passage thus, in eo (Teani ?) quod est ab Larino
xviii milia passuum. publicis is inserted by all MSS. except ST aster
ludis.

28. -28. optime, ST and VVramp. 's codd.; optima, R (which Kl., Miill. ‚
Ry. adopt). Classen’s argument is just—the question is not of the degree
or quality of Sassia’s hope : it is ‘ una tantum et certa spes, scilieet amplioris
hereditatis,’ in which this murder most effectively (optime) confirms her.
30. ita quod: itaque, ΡΜ, and so Orelli 3 ita quum . . . soleant,
Schiilz. But quod. is idiomatic Latin: v, explan. n. 32. iucundum,

Ἴ STM, Bait. , Kays., KL, Miill. 3 iucundius, R, Orelli, Ry. The latter
reading gives what is only a spurious antithesis to cupidiores, ‘ more
covetous [than they otherwise would be]‚' qualifying the censure : no such
sense can be given to iucundius esse duxit: the censure of Opp. must be
unqualified. [⁶ Rather pleasant ' might be said in bitter scorn. H. J. R.]

X. 29.—Page 11, 1. 7. auditis non . . . sine, S. 9. breviter a me
strictimque, so all but ST, which omit a me. But the antithesis to 1. 15, a
P. Cannutio, requires them. 10. de omitted before quo by ST. When the

demonstrative antecedent has been governed by a monosyllabic preposition,
the latter may be omitted before the relative, if the two are so closely
connected that the same verb is understood. So lx'osc. Am. ἓ 127, in
