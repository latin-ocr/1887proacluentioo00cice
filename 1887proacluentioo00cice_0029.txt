INTRODUCTION. xxi

ΙΙΙ. NARRATIVE OF THE PAsT HISTORY OF CLUENTIUS AND
OPPIANICUS As 1T MAY BE GATHERED FROM CICERo's
SPEECH. How FAR 1s 1T TRUSTWORTHY?

ἓ 1. The intricacy of the plot is certainly the greatest
difficulty which confronts the student who takes up the
Cluentiana for the first time. Hence a careful examination
of the genealogical and other tables to be found in this
Introduction cannot be too earnestly recommended. It may
be well, however, to supplement these by a running narrative
based upon the words of Cicero. Oppianicus has indeed
sared badly in his biographer, whose statements we may here
and there find occasion to criticise, but lack the means to
controvert.

§a A. Cluentius Habitus the elder, father of the defen-
dant, was the leading man in the township and district of
Larinum, in the country of the Frentani, where he died in
B.C. 88, leaving behind him his wife, Sassia, and two children,
a son, A. Cluentius Habitus, and a daughter, Cluentia, the
elder of the two, who soon afterwards married A. Aurius
Melinus, her first cousin, son of Sassia's sister. It was a happy
marriage. But here the fatal'act of passion intervenes, which
was to open a chapter of horrors, ‘initium huic cum matre
simultatis ⁷ (ξ 17). Sassia, who seemed able like a Cleopatra
or a Canidia to fascinate and to blast by her imperious beauty,
alienated the young husband⁷s affections. He divorced his
wife and married her mother.

ξ 3, We are soon introduced to a new actor, whose hostility
to the defendant had been as bitter, but less successful,——Statius
Albius Oppianicus the elder, an eques of Larinum. It is the
interest of the advocate to depict his character and career in
the darkest colours, so as to establish an ‘argument from
antecedents' (probabile ex vita) for his guilt in regard to the
charge of poisoning afterwards brought against him by
Cluentius, and the illicit means he took to procure an acquittal.
He is a sort of Roman ‘ Bluebeard '-—‘ homo in necandis uxori-
bus exercitatus‚' ξ 52 : his first wife Cluentia, aunt of the pro-
secutor, he poisoned: the next, Magia, died: the third, Papia,
widow of his brother-in-law Cn. Magius, married him under
very dishonourable circumstances and was divorced by him:
the fourth, Novia, died ι last came Sassia. We may notice, as an
incidental proof of the general truthfulness of the details, that
