xxx INTRODUCTION.

F irst came the condemnation of C. Junius, the iudex
quaestionis} who had presided at the trial, and with whose
name it was henceforth associated quite as often as with that
of the accused.2 The impeachment preferred by Quinctius
was based on technical grounds, mainly in connection with
the subsortitio or supplementary appointment of Fidiculanius
Falcula, which Junius was suspected to have made in the
interests of Cluentius. Here it suits the convenience of Cicero
to call the charges ‘ frivolous and trumpery ' 3 he had expressed
a different opinion on another occasion.3

Closely connected with this trial were those of C. F idicula-
nius Falcula himself, who was accused in the first instance of
informality in acting as a juror in a case in which the decury
to which he belonged was not competent to act. He was
acquitted on this charge, but soon afterwards directly accused
of having received a bribe from Cluentius, and found not
guilty. Cicero does well to make much of this verdict3 it is ’
a strong testimony for Cluentius. Yet in the pro Caea,
delivered only three years before the present speech, the
orator accepts the popular opinion that Falcula gave the
decisive vote, and that he had got 50,000 sesterces for it 3
that is, Cluentius had outbid Oppianicus, who gave 40‚000‚ by
10‚000 sesterces.4

The other verdicts were adverse to Cluentius, even if only
indirectly so. Bulbus was found guilty of maiestas 3 Popilius ἢ
of ambitus 3 Gutta of the same 3 Staienus of maiestas 3 Scaevola
of repetandae. In all these cases their alleged misconduct in
the trial of Oppianicus told against the defendants; in the last
named, it was taken into account in the litis aestimatio, or
assessment of damages which followed the verdict.

ἕ 13. There were also other ‘ decisions,' as the prosecution
called them, though Cicero disputes the propriety of the term.

⁴ Cp. n. on ξ 104. The passage in pro Caec. ἓ 28 runs: ‘ Cum ita
vehemens acerque venisset, ut non modo Caecinam periurio suo laederet,
sed etiam mihi videretur irasci, ita eum placidum mollemque reddidi, ut
non auderet . . . iterum dicere, quot milia fundus suus abesset ab urbe.
Nam cum dixisset minus 1031), populus cum risu acclamavit ipsa esse.
Meminerant enim omnes, quantum in Albiano iudicio accepisset. When
he said ‘less than 50,' the people cried that it was just his figure; fifty
thousand was the bribe he took in the famous trial. (The rest of the
passage should be read.)
