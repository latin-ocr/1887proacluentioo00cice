world, as soon as he found that with regard to the end of his being he
lost rather than gained by living, and as patriotism decayed men ceased
to feel that their lives belonged to their country as much as to them-

sensum doloris, Doubtless Cic. is speaking here as the advocate, not as
the philosopher or religious teacher. But, granting this, from a man of
high character, such as he was, we expect consistency in essentials. The
commentators here refer in his defence to the words of § 139, omnes illae
orationes causarum ac temporum sunt, non hominum ipsorum aut patro-
norum, and imply that he here disowns convictions which he held intima
mente, with regard to the immortality of the soul and the reality of a
future state, and which he has enunciated in the Tusculan Disputatzbns
(Book i.)‚ in the Somnium Scipionis, the de Senectute, and the de
Amicitia. But it seems to us that this is not so. All that is alleged here
as to a future state is, that the wicked are not haunted in another world
by Furies and other creations of the popular imagination, but lose in
death their consciousness. One other passage avers the contrary, it is
true, but it is from a speech, not a philosophical treatise: Philipp. xiv.
ἓ 32, illi igitur impii, quos cecidistis, etiam ad inferos poenas parricidii
luent3 vos vero, qui extremum spiritum in victoria effudistis, piorum
estis sedem et locum consecuti. Both passages are highly rhetorical.
Now of the fate of the wz'cked in a future world, Cicero seems to say
nothing positive in his philosophical writings. He speaks of the immor-
tality of the soul in general, and his own intellectual position is best ,
stated in the words of T usc. i. §25, mortem . . . quae aut beatos nos
efficiet animis manentibus aut non miseros sensu carentes ; de Senect. ἓ 74,
post mortem quidem sensus aut optandus aut nullus est: his saith or
pious opinion in the words of dc Amic. ἓ 13, neque adsentior eis qui . . .
disserere coeperunt, cum corporibus simul animos interire. He believes,
moreover, that the good are rewarded in a future state. And to this
saith, hesitating as it is, he adheres in his speeches: cp. the eulogy on
Ser. Sulpicius in Phil. ix., especially ἓ 13, gratior illi videtur, si qui est
sensus in morte, aenea statua futura3 Sest. ξ 131, si est aliqui sensusin
morte praeclarorum virorum. In Sest. ἓ 47 he states the alternatives just
as in T usc. i. ἓ 2 5. Enough has been said to show that Cic. is consistent
as far as he goes. There is no ‘ Ardiaeus the tyrant' suffering the pains
of hell in the Somn. Scipionis. The closing words of that allegory,
adapted from Plat. Phacd. 81 c, cannot be taken very literally: eorum
animi, qui se corporis voluptatibus dediderunt earumque se quasi ministros
praebuerunt impulsuque libidinum voluptatibus oboedientium deorum et
hominum iura violaverunt, corporibus elapsi circum terram ipsam volu-
tantur nec hunc in locum [scil. in caelum] nisi multis exagitati saeculis
