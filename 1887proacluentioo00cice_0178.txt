Aletrium, as in Greek Ἀλέτριον and Ἀλάτριον, was in the country of the
Hernici, a few miles to the north of the Via Latina, about ten miles due
east of Anagnia and six miles north of Ferentinum. The modern town
Alatri is chiefly interesting from the circumstance that the walls which
encompassed the ancient city and its citadel still remain almost entire,
presenting perhaps the finest and most perfect example in existence os
that very ancient and massive style of building which is now generally
termed Polygonal. Arpinum, the birthplace of Cicero, where also there
is a fine Polygonal wall, lies about sixteen miles south-east from Aletrium,
and the proximity of the two towns is alluded to in the next chapter (xvii.

the world even in Herodotus' day, who tells us that, among them, those of
Kroton in Magna Graecia were the most famous. Cp. the story of
